Info about an upcoming album from [Madonna][1] is mentioned on [FemaleFirst][2]. Apparently it&#8217;s gonna be &#8220;heavily rock influenced &#8211; after being inspired by glam British rockers [The Darkness][3]&#8220;. Could the producer be Headcleanr, who&#8217;s rock remixes been on her last few singles? If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;m officially excited. :)
