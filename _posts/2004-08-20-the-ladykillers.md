I haven&#8217;t seen the original <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048281/">Ladykillers</a>, but this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335245/">remake</a> by the Coen brothers was pretty entertaining. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/">Tom Hanks</a> plays an eccentric, if not charming Southern professor out to rob a casino, all under the nose of his unsuspecting landlord: a sharp old woman. Check it out if you think you&#8217;d enjoy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/">Oceans 11</a> (or any other casino heist movie) twisted up with the Coen kind of pace, gospel, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.poemuseum.org/">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, smooth talking, extreme cursing, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.visitmississippi.org/">Mississippi</a> and a cute little cat.
