IRC quote from a discussion about Steve Jobs&#8217; [Keynote][1] at the Macworld expo:

> -Wonder how many times Steve Jobs said &#8220;fantastic&#8221; during the presentation&#8230;  
> -Wonder how many times he though &#8220;WTF?!&#8221;

The [Mac Mini][2] seems amazing! I&#8217;ve almost decided I&#8217;m gonna get me one. It kind of depends on whether or not I can buy it without the sales tax through work.
