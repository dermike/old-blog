What&#8217;s better than starting out a 4 day weekend with the new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vnvnation.com">VNV Nation</a> DVD &#8220;Pastperfect&#8221;? Depends on your mood. The first thing that annoyed me was the DVD production itself. No 5.1 sound, only 2-channel dolby. Second, the sound isn&#8217;t from one continous concert, but mixed from different sound sources&#8230; who knows exactly. This definately brings down the production, which otherwise is very good considering design and packing.  
It&#8217;s not all bad though, when coming to track 4, &#8220;Honour&#8221; (my favourite), you can really feel the raw energy and that live feeling!

> Stand your ground this is what we are fighting for. For our spirit and laws and ways. Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war. For heaven or hell we shall not wait. Shall I think of honour as lies? Or lament it&#8217;s aged slow demise? Shall I stand as a total stranger? On this day in this stone chamber?

Even though the DVD is not flawless, it&#8217;s essential for any fan. I haven&#8217;t checked out the other discs yet, but I feel they might as well put it all on one dual-layered DVD instead of 2 single.  
After that I watched <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360009/">Spartan</a>, a pretty good action thriller starring <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000174/">Val Kilmer</a>. Watch it if you get the chance.
