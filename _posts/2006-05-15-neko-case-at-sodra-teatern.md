Last night&#8217;s been on my mind all day. The haircut of supporting [Catherine Irwin][1], the irresistible backup singer [Rachel Flotard][2], how I want a [pedal steel][3] guitar, and of course the constant echoes of [Neko][4] singing ([video][5] from &#8220;Hold on hold on&#8221;). She hates auto tune with a [passion][6], and I was amazed by the almost studio like performance&#8230; As a perfect ending, the not in stores &#8220;Canadian Amp&#8221; CD was sold at the merchandise stand!
