The second compilation from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a> label <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meteosound.net/">Meteosound</a> is out! I really liked the first one which I primarily bought for it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.barbaramorgenstern.de">Barbara Morgenstern</a> track.

> Meteosound likes to present another unique collection featuring its favorite dub sounds of today. Hiphop and techno influenced, rootical and soulful electronics, downbeat and upskankin tracks.

The cd is compiled by the labelowner, DJ and producer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meteosound.net/daniel/f_dan.html">Daniel Meteo</a>, and features tracks from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flowing.de/">Thomas Fehlmann</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theorb.com/">The Orb</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meteosound.net/bus/f_b.html">Bus</a> among others.
