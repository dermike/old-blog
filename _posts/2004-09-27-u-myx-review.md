<a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/archives/2004/08/20/muse-introduces-u-myx/">At first</a> it looked like a dream come true for music fans and remixers, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.muse.mu">Muse&#8217;s</a> new single equipped with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.u-myx.com">U-myx</a> only seem to have charmed [fans who didn&#8217;t expect much][1]. This is definately [not a revolution][2]. You can scarcely just switch on and off the different parts of the song. Listen to my rough [&#8220;Calm Before The Storm Mix&#8221;][3], and you&#8217;ll get the picture. The good news is that U-myx can only get better. Try me again when you can actually add your own sounds and ideas, or at least have [more elements][4] to play with.
