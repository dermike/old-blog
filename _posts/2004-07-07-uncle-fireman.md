My uncle in Australia, whom I don&#8217;t know very well, just passed the test or education to become a fireman.. at his age! (45) Me and Sis&#8217; (who can&#8217;t take her hands off the new 3G phone she just bought) had dinner at our grandmothers tonight, and according to her, he said in a dodgy way that we&#8217;ll &#8220;see&#8221; eachother on his upcoming birthday. I&#8217;m hoping for a surprise visist. :) I&#8217;ve only met him like twice in my life or something.
