Really slow day work-wise today, but good for talking. While trying to learn some new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop</a> shortcut keys we (me and the other new guy) went to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.officeone.se/">Office One</a> to pick up our new computers. They were of course not ready yet, so we had to wait there for like an hour. I was pretty annoyed since I didn&#8217;t get an optical mouse (although I think I got one anyway).  
Me and the other new guy discussed music while bossy smoked. (I hope this was the last ride I have to take with his smell-of-smoke car). We talked about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thastrom.nu/">Thåström</a> and how we looked forward to his new album&#8230;which I guess still is unconfirmed. I thought it would be cool if his songs were remixed by his industrial side project <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalfarmers.com/kennel/">Peace Love & Pitbulls</a>. Guess no one except us would like that. Feels good with a soul mate in that matter at least. :) On the way home I was kept going by a nice discussion about language theory and philosophy.. Kind of cosy actually, getting paid for talking. :)  
&#8220;We&#8217;re all whores&#8221; said boss and continued talking about customer phone relations&#8230;

Aah.. had the new limited edition <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aufdermaur.com/">Melissa Auf Der Maur</a>-single in the mail when I got home. :)
