Tomorrow is the re-release of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lacunacoil.it">Lacuna Coil</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Comalies&#8221; album. It&#8217;s a limited 2CD deluxe edition with a bonus-CD containing acoustic and live versions. (It will become the 600th entry of <a target="_blank" href="http://english.skivsamling.nu/show.pl?id=23070">my record collection</a> :).

> &#8220;While Lacuna Coil are already working on their yet untitled follow-up for the successful album &#8220;Comalies&#8221;, a European re-release of their two EPs &#8220;Lacuna Coil&#8221; and &#8220;Halflife&#8221; &#8211; which are currently out of print and thus demanded &#8211; including new artwork and bonus-material &#8211; is in the making for this summer.&#8221;

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.centurymedia.de">Century Media</a> sure commits. LC will also be on the &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.centurymedia.de/century/index.aspx?page=4&#038;id=117">Miss Behaviour</a>&#8221; compilation. The top female fronted metal bands on a CD + bonus DVD. Released tomorrow as well.
