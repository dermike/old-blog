> &#8220;Consumption of new technology has again divided the world into zones; [Filtro][1] takes advantage of this phenomenon and uses it as a pretext to release [Region 4][2]; a new compilation which generates a dialogue between Jamaican dancehall music, reggaeton, dubstep, its applications dance music trends suchs as UK's Grime as well as the own minimal and idm sounds from our label's musicians.&#8221;

Interesting thoughts from this netlabel. Not so sure about the results though&#8230;
