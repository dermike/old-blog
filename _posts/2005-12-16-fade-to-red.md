The complete [Tori Amos][1] video collection has been longed for since the dawn of DVD. &#8220;Fade To Red&#8221;, released on February 14 2006, is a 2 disc DVD set including 21 videos as well as bonus features like behind the scenes footage and a comprehensive audio commentary by Tori, all remastered in 5.1 surround sound. Tracklist available at [Everything Tori][2]. Just as with Seinfeld, I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t rush for a release until the format was truly ready.
