A very sad day if <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deadlikemeonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6990">this</a> is more than just a rumour. If true, there will be no third season of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deadlikeme.tv/">&#8220;Dead Like Me&#8221;</a> tv series. :( It&#8217;s a shame if such a unique show as this is cancelled so early. I&#8217;d rather see them quit while they&#8217;re ahead though, than let the show become watered down. The ending of season 2 was very worthy at least.
