I&#8217;ve been at the new job for a week now and starting to settle down. Here I&#8217;m describing a typical day at the office:

<u>07:18</u>: I get out of bed after waking up to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sr.se/p3/">P3</a> on the radio, shower, make a cup of coffee and skim through <a target="_blank" href="http://computersweden.idg.se/">Computer Sweden</a> and the cultural pages of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.svd.se">SvD</a> (switching back to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dn.se">DN</a> soon).

<u>07:46</u>: I hurry out to my bike and start to pedal. When I pass the suburban farm, I want to take a romantic mobile picture of the grazing horse right beside the road.  
&#8220;Tomorrow&#8221;, I think to myself.

<u>08:02</u>: Entering the office panting. Kero, the office dog, wants to inspect my lunch box.  
&#8220;Good morning&#8221; everybody. Usually just 2 more at this time. I gradually end up in front of my computer and start doing some work.

<u>10:00:00</u>: Break. Not a second after 10. The smokers are more punctual than an atomic watch. Me and the other non-smokers chat in the kitchen instead.

<u>12:06</u>: Lunch. Boss goes out somewhere and the rest of us start up the microwave ovens. Mr. M whistles &#8220;Popcorn&#8221; or any of his karaoke hits that day while heating up the frozen food. Chat + coffee and then back to work. A walk with Mr. P and Kero is optional.

<u>15:06</u>: Afternoon break. The smokers are eager to suck another one down, but I tend to just grab a soft drink and carry on.

<u>17:12</u>: After finishing up I grab my jacket and go home. Note to self: Oil up the bicycle chain! &#8220;Tomorrow&#8221;, I reply subconsciously.  
At home.. Computer + dinner + <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesimpsons.com/">Simpsons</a> (or any other favourite tv show) + more computer&#8230;. Then zZz.
