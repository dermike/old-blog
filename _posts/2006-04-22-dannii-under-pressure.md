The song might be &#8220;inspired&#8221; from her sisters illness, but does it really have to sound and look so much like her? Having [Dannii][1] as my favourite Minogue, it saddens me she&#8217;s given up her own sound from the &#8220;Neon Nights&#8221; album. Her new single and [video][2], &#8220;So Under Pressure&#8221;, just screams [Kylie][3]. All is forgiven if I get a [Jacques Lu Cont][4] remix though&#8230;
