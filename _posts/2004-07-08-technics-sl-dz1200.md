Oh oh oh ooooooooooooh&#8230; \*drooling\* Give me 2 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/technics_dj/video_flash.asp">those</a>! This just makes me miss my old turntables more than usual..

> The Technics SL-DZ1200, the world's first Direct-Drive Digital Turntable, "looks and more importantly feels" like spinning wax on a classic 1200. The SL-DZ1200 also lets you store, playback, scratch and loop sampled media from a removable SD memory card.

Only $1,199.95 ;).. I think I&#8217;d be happy with just one for music playback when I get my own place anyway. :)
