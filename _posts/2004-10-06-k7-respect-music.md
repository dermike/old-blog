<a target="_blank" href="http://www.k7.com">!K7 Records</a> call for a respectful attitude towards music. Shortly after <a target="_blank" href="http://www.www.sonymusic.com">Sony</a> announced they will <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/01/sony_copy-control_cd/">stop using</a> copy control, !K7 take it one step further! From now on, all their releases will carry a new logo: &#8220;NO copy protection &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.k7.com/news.pl?id=75">respect the music</a>&#8220;. 

> &#8220;This makes it clear that you&#8217;ve bought a CD and you can use it however you want. It&#8217;s also clear, therefore, that good music has a prerogative &#8211; it has a right to be treated with respect.&#8221;

Finally a label who understand that copy protection kills customer relationships.
