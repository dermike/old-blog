Whoa! <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anti.com">ANTI.com</a>, where real artists create great recordings on their own terms, have signed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nekocase.com">Neko Case</a> for 2 new albums! She&#8217;s been making a name for herself over the past few years in both indie-rock and country circles as a solo artist and as a member of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/">New Pornographers</a>. First to be released is &#8220;The Tigers Have Spoken&#8221; (out in November). A live album recorded over 7 nights and at 3 different venues in Chicago and Toronto with a full band. I&#8217;m more excited about what&#8217;s next though&#8230; The follow-up to her mindblowing studio album &#8220;Blacklisted&#8221;, due out in the Spring of 2005! Yes, that is drool on my chin. :) Hopefully Joey Burns and Howe Gelb from [Calexico][1] will be involved this time too. A review of &#8220;Blacklisted&#8221; is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dagensskiva.com/index.asp?datum=2002-12-6">dagensskiva.com</a> (se).
