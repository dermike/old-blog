Knowing that [Alias][1] is back for it&#8217;s fourth season today will probably ease my waking up process in the morning. :) In addition to my excitement, I also discovered this prequel book, [Infiltration][2], by one of the writers of the show.  
Found it cheapest at [Akademibokhandeln][3], which wasn&#8217;t even included in the price comparison at [bokfynd.nu][4].
