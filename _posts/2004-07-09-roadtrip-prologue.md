I&#8217;m going on a little roadtrip with my father tomorrow. We&#8217;ll be stopping by my grandparents for a night or two in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nassjo.se/">Nässjö</a>, and then over to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sassnitz.de/">Sassnitz</a> and Germany via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trelleborg.se/">Trelleborg</a>. From there it&#8217;s undecided. I&#8217;ll be pushing for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a> of course, but I&#8217;m not the one driving, so we&#8217;ll see. ;) The way back home will be through Denmark. I have no idea how many days, but no more than seven. The trip will be documented as good as I can through the [live mobile cam][1] and blog entries via email, assuming my mobile phone will work. According to [Tre][2], there shouldn&#8217;t be any problems. :) Time to compile some mix-cd&#8217;s for the car&#8230;
