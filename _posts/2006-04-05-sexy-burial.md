I&#8217;m very impressed by [Burial][1]. It&#8217;s not so much about the music he makes, more about how, his ways and thoughts, uncovered in this interview by [Blackdown][2]. The press release decribes his upcoming album on [Hyperdub][3], made without a sequencer in [Soundforge][4](!), as &#8220;a sound which sends the dormant slinky syncopations of uk garage, via radio interference, into a padded cell of cushioned, muffled bass, passing through the best of [Pole's][5] Berlin crackle dub&#8221;. It&#8217;s sexy dubstep to me.

> -&#8221;But there's plenty of people who if they were given any room, would make dubstep sound like slowed down drum & bass. And those people are terrified of those sexy vibes I'm talking about. They don't want this music to have come from garage.&#8221;

Until the album is out on May 15, listen to the [Breezeblock][6] album preview (mp3 rip of it [here][7]), get his &#8220;South London Boroughs EP&#8221; from [Bleep][8] and read the full [interview][2].
