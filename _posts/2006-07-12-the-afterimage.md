&#8220;Afterimage&#8221; is the farewell sounds of dubstep&#8217;s number one blogger [Gutterbreakz][1]. The mix assembles some of the artists working outside of the scene&#8217;s London-centic core. An alternative [&#8220;Dubstep Allstars&#8221;][2], and far better if you ask me. You&#8217;ll find the download and an interview over at [Riddim.ca][3]! Couldn&#8217;t ask for a better soundtrack when driving down to the Berlin [dubstep weekend][4] in an hour&#8230;
