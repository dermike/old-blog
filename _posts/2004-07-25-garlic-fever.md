<a target="_blank" href="http://www.carlaberatio.com">Tobbe</a> took us out for dinner tonight at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alltomstockholm.tv4.se/profile?fid=2&#038;id=860890">Olsson Brothers Garlic & Shots</a> restaurant. Everything has garlic in it. Garlic beer, garlic coffe.. even garlic icecream&#8230;and so on. They also have a restaurant in Soho, London. After that we went down to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doubleo.se">Double O</a> bar in the basement. We sat in the <a target="_blank" href="http://cam.redvolume.com/archive/PIC000074.jpg">Transylvania Lounge</a> section, listening to the ska, reggae, rocksteady, punk and rock&#8217;n roll that was played in the tropical heat down there. I have a new favourite bar. :)
