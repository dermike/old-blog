Me and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carlaberatio.com">Tobbe</a> just got home from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.faulbaum.tk/">Faulfest #2</a>! First we listened to the very talented <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brittapersson.com">Britta Persson</a>. Of all the flowers in the meadows of singer/songwriters, she really deserves to be grown in a flower bed. :) She actually brought the sun to the otherwise very gloomy and rainy festival area.  
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.iloveyoubaby.se/">I Love You Baby!</a> was next. A quite good electropop band, inspired from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kraftwerk.com/">Kraftwerk</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pattismith.net/">Patti Smith</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.letigreworld.com/">Le Tigre</a>. Bought their new 8-track EP released on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trewetharecords.com/">Trewetha</a>.  
And then&#8230; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.diapazam.se/">Blanka</a>!! They sure didn&#8217;t disappoint me! Most new tracks from the upcoming album was stunning! Although the sound was kind of bad, a speaker was broken or something, they just made my waiting for the new album harder. :)
