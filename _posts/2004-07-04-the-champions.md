Wow, I&#8217;m very impressed by Greece winning the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.euro2004.com/">Euro2004</a> soccer tournament! Congratulations! According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beckenbauer.de/">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, commentator at the German tv channel <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zdf.de">ZDF</a>, this is the biggest sensation in football for 50 years! (from <a target="_blank" href="http://sodergren.com/chadie/archives/000944.html">Chadie</a>). A big thanks to all teams for making this the most exciting championship in a very long time! :)
