<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pjharvey.net">PJ Harvey</a> released the single &#8220;The Letter&#8221; today, which is the first taste of the highly anticipated new album, &#8220;Uh Hu Her&#8221;. The new sound is picked up from Josh Homme of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.queensofthestoneage.com">Queens Of The Stone Age</a> and his &#8220;Desert Sessions&#8221; side project, on which PJ appeared last year. Since I&#8217;m a big fan of her last album, &#8220;Stories From The City..&#8221;, I&#8217;m a little disappointed in this new turn. I guess my wet dream would be Josh Homme producing it the stoner rock way, like QOTSA. But anyway&#8230; I&#8217;m just glad she&#8217;s back! :)
