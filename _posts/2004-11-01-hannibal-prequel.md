Yummy! This is great news! <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/041029d.php">Dark Horizons</a> report that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/thomasharris/">Thomas Harris</a> is currently working on the 4th book about <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter">Dr. Hannibal Lecter</a>! Set in the 1940s in Europe, the prequel will reveal Hannibal&#8217;s childhood in Lithuania.
