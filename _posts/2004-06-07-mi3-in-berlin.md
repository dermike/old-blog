Cool! I guess we will see a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a> in the forthcoming <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317919/">Mission: Impossible 3</a> movie.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/">Tom</a> sure has good taste. :) I really enjoyed watching the first two M:I movies, and I&#8217;m pretty sure this one won&#8217;t be an exception.
