I finally framed and put up my old <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/temp/shiva.jpg">Shiva poster</a>. I&#8217;ve always liked the hindu kind of spirituality. Feels good to have it back on a wall. :)

The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja">puja</a> says: &#8220;Salutations to Shiva who wears a serpent as garland, who is three-eyed, whose bare body is covered with ashes, who is forever pure and the very embodiment of sacrifice.&#8221;
