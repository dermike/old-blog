This is so typical. I&#8217;ve been wanting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidbowie.com">David Bowie&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Rebel Never Gets Old&#8221; mash-up remix CD ever since it was announced. It&#8217;s only been available on limited vinyl and promo-CD&#8217;s, sold for fantasy sums, on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</a> so far&#8230; and first now, when I&#8217;ve just <u>returned</u> from Germany, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidbowie.com/news/newsContent.php?id=20040715">I find out</a> there&#8217;s a special edition of the album &#8220;Reality&#8221; that includes the RNGO disc there. :( Guess I&#8217;ll have to wait until payday now to order it from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.de">Amazon.de</a>&#8230; How do I convince myself that I can wait a week? :P
