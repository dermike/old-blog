The newsletter from [Downhill Battle][1], a non-profit organization working to end the major label monopoly and build a better and fairer music industry, tells me about their latest project, [Battle Torrent][2]. I&#8217;ve never tried this <a target="_blank" href="http://dessent.net/btfaq/">torrent</a> thing, but since I&#8217;m sympathetic to their cause I&#8217;m spreading the word about their just launched website [sp2torrent.com][3]. :) 

> It&#8217;s a site that links to BitTorrent files of the Windows XP Service Pack that Microsoft has announced. Microsoft is limiting their release of this update due to bandwidth concerns, and we&#8217;re taking this chance to show that p2p technology can get the file out to anyone who wants it, without massive server requirements. We&#8217;re not doing this to help Microsoft (believe me), but rather as a demonstration of why p2p is valuable.
