Just finished my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/spooks">Spooks</a> season 2 marathon. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why I love dvds, you can watch it all at once. :) Well, at least more than one episode a day. Some might say that it&#8217;s part of the charm to see one episode a week, but it gets much more intense this way&#8230; Try it! Can&#8217;t wait for season 3 which is currently being filmed. To be aired this autumn.

And oh.. check this out. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loftcube.net/main.html">The Loftcube</a>. Looks cosy, doesn&#8217;t it?
