Sigh.. A very childish seller on [Ebay][1] just left me negative feedback for simply giving him a neutral. Apparently I&#8217;m hard to please, and so is everyone who&#8217;s left him bad or neutral feedback. I&#8217;m sorry for mentioning your CD&#8217;s come with a terrible stench of smoke (that won&#8217;t even air out). If I&#8217;d known that, I wouldn&#8217;t have bought the CD in the first place. I&#8217;m not even the only one who&#8217;s complained about it. The CD is [Aimee Mann&#8217;s][2] &#8220;Ultimate Collection&#8221;. I&#8217;ll give it away to anyone who wants it. Call me pedantic, but I don&#8217;t want an album that smells in my [collection][3]. Take it, it&#8217;s yours&#8230;
