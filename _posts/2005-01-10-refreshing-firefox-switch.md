I did it. The switch to [Firefox][1] and [Thunderbird][2]. Only. No more Internet Explorer. It&#8217;s not that I had anything against it, surfing with ActiveX turned off kept me worry free, and old habits die hard&#8230; Reading [this][3] at work today however made me abandon it with 5 easy clicks (or something like it). :) Those import guides were just phenomenal! Never been easier. Didn&#8217;t have to do one thing manually. I&#8217;m feeling very refreshed.
