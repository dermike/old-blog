The rain makes us stay inside at the small backstreet hotel, watching some motor program on TV. I can&#8217;t wait to see the &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ankelatenight.de">Anke Late Night</a>&#8221; show at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sat1.de/">SAT1</a> later. A female flipped out version of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbs.com/lateshow/">Letterman</a>. I&#8217;m in love. :) She made one of the funniest interviews I&#8217;ve ever seen with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emmabuntonofficial.com/">Emma Bunton</a> the other day. Mixing and live translating german and english, sometimes with her own interpretations while the other guest, a comedian, made naughty comments. :) We had the &#8220;must eat specialty&#8221; day today. DÃ¶ner kebap in Berlin and schnitzel here in Rostock. We also did our beer and liqour shopping, since we probably won&#8217;t have time tomorrow. The ferry leaves at 10 for Denmark. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.warsteiner.de/">Warsteiner</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.becks.com/">Becks</a> and Hansa beer for me. :) Back to the telly.. I&#8217;ll be home tomorrow night&#8230;
