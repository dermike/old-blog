Not much work left on the layout now. Some fine tuning on the menu column and I&#8217;m about done. I&#8217;ll leave that for now&#8230; Need to relax a little. Gonna go out in the sun and start reading &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679752609/qid=1088695624/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-8507174-5296645?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846">Buddenbrooks</a>&#8221; by Thomas Mann. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.svt.se">SVT</a> is showing &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250573/">Die Manns</a>&#8220;, a three part drama/documentary about the Mann family. It&#8217;s very captivating, mixing drama with authentic interviews. Mostly with Elisabeth Mann, but also older archive footage with &#8220;Golo&#8221; and Erika. The last part will be aired on sunday (18.15 @ SVT2). A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E261N/qid=1088696016/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl74/302-4774588-0382453">DVD-box</a> of it is available in Germany, but without english subs I&#8217;m afraid.
