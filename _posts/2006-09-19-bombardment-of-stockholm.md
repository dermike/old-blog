On September 30th, the Friendly Fire [release tour][1] hits Stockhom at [Kafe 44][2], which is all about the [Vex&#8217;d][3] boys from London. Dark electronic dub and industrial rhythms like that will be the perfect autumn starter. Gear up with their album, &#8220;Degenerate&#8221;, currently on sale at [Dotshop][4].
