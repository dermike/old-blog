Took the family to see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.michaelmoore.com">Michael Moore&#8217;s</a> &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>&#8221; today. It sure didn&#8217;t make me feel good. Very scary. Everyone should see it though! I calmed myself down by browsing the 2005 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a> catalog. Looking at all those well decorated rooms, you get the feeling there&#8217;s no evil in the world. Only beauty and comfort. :) I was actually looking for a record cabinet and a nice frame for my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/">Magnolia</a> poster, when I found the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ikea.se/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=2&#038;langId=-11&#038;catalogId=10101&#038;categoryId=13151&#038;cattype=sub">Kodal</a> closet. It looks to me that keeping your clothes visible, in the open, is the new trend. Me wants!
