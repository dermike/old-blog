Sigh.. Got home just in time to stop an ongoing trackback spam attack. :( Just turning it off in options wasn&#8217;t enough. I had to use SQL to set all entries in the database to ping_status &#8220;closed&#8221;. My choice now is to either live without trackbacks (shouldn&#8217;t be a problem), or [find another][1] anti-spam plugin that can handle both comments and pings.
