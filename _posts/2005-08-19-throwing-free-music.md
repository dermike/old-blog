> &#8220;Money has so polluted the music world that my overwhelming urge right now is to divorce money from recorded music. Over the last 2 years we&#8217;ve been asking people to help us educate listeners about [50 Foot Wave][1] and we&#8217;ve met resistance every step of the way &#8212; caused by little other than money &#8212; and to an extent I&#8217;ve never seen before. So we&#8217;re sending free recordings off into the world to do their work. If people enjoy these songs and are excited by them, we ask that they share them with others. The music business is about fame and huge profits: egos and greed; but if enough people care, 50 Foot Wave will earn an honest living playing live, which is what we love to do.&#8221; &#8211; Kristin Hersh

Look for a new 50 Foot Wave Ep, [free][2] for download in the next couple of months.
