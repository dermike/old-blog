<a target="_blank" href="http://www.intro.de/index.php?nav=&#038;con=/news/news&#038;einenews=1094479346&#038;az=&#038;">Intro.de</a> reports that a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nirvanaclub.com/">Nirvana</a> 3 CD boxset will be released in November! The boxset, which was originally announced 3 years ago, will include previously unreleased rarities and b-sides, over 50 unreleased recordings including Kurt Cobain&#8217;s demos and a 60 page booklet. The first edition will also include a DVD, filmed at a houseparty gig in 1987. A wet dream for any Nirvana fan. :) I&#8217;m not sure I need 3 cd&#8217;s full of lo-fi recordings (?) though&#8230; but we&#8217;ll see.
