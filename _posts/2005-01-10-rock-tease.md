I&#8217;ve never been good at waiting, and these three teasers for upcoming albums just turned my waiting into desperate yearning:

Teaser [trailer][1] for [Porcupine Tree&#8217;s][2] &#8220;Darkwing&#8221; (18 mb Quicktime). (March 21).  
Flash [Ecard][3] for [Mars Volta&#8217;s][4] upcoming single &#8220;The Widow&#8221;. (March 1)  
Download [single][5] from &#8220;The Beekeeper&#8221; by [Tori Amos][6]. (February 22)

I&#8217;m counting the seconds&#8230;
