You can now listen to [Madonna&#8217;s][1] new single &#8220;Hung Up&#8221; on her [MySpace][2] page. [Stuart][3] did a great job producing it, but ABBA just doesn&#8217;t do it for me. Reading about the upcoming [Massive Attack][4] album made my heart beat a little faster though. &#8220;Gothic soul&#8221; is how the sound is described. Gimme gimme gimme!
