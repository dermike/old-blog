I was already dying for the second season of [Weeds][1] to kick off (Aug 14), and now there&#8217;s even more to look forward to. The theme song, &#8220;Little Boxes&#8221; by [Malvina Reynolds][2], will each week be reinterpreted by a different artist. Those who signed up for this include Elvis Costello, Death Cab for Cutie, Jenny Lewis, the Polyphonic Spree&#8217;s Tim DeLaughter and Regina Spektor among others&#8230; There will also be a guest appearance from [Snoop Dogg][3], but after his, in my opinion, stupid role in [The L Word][4], I&#8217;m not too excited. Someone over at [Showtime][5] must really love him.
