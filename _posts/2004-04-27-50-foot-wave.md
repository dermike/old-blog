No <a target="_blank" href="http://www.50footwave.com">50 Foot Wave</a> CD in the mail today. :( 

> 50 Foot Wave is comprised of Throwing Muses front woman Kristin Hersh, joined by Muses? bassist Bernard Georges and new drummer Rob Ahlers. This is Hersh&#8217;s first new band since she founded the influential Throwing Muses and promises to be a harder, faster, more intense experience.

From the samples I&#8217;ve heard I&#8217;m sure this will be on heavy rotation in my player the next weeks. Listen and order from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/50footwave/">CD Baby</a>, who simply has the coolest order confirmation mails on earth! :)
