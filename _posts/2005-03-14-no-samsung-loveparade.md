They did the right thing. &#8220;[Loveparade][1] belongs to nobody&#8221;, was the answer when [Samsung][2] wanted to sponsor this year&#8217;s demonstration under their own banner, &#8220;Samsung Loveparade&#8221;. Now without a sponsor, there&#8217;s a chance the parade will have to be cancelled a second time since it&#8217;s start in 1989 (since 1996 in [Tiergarten][3]). No need to worry yet though according to the management, who claims to have other possible sponsors. July 9th is still official until further notice&#8230;
