<a target="_blank" href="http://www.porcupinetree.com">Porcupine Tree</a> have recorded 14 new songs for an album (untitled so far) to be released sometime in January. What&#8217;s left to do is basically just to select, sequence and master the final running order. There is also plans for a simultaneous release of a 5.1 surround mix&#8230; I usually prefer stereo recordings, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the surround mix beats stereo in PT&#8217;s case. Probably just the usual scam to make fans buy two copies. :P
