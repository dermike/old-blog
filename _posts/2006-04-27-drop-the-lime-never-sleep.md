The sound of never sleeping? Might just be. [Drop The Lime][1] being back on track with some upbeat stuff saved my day (his latest EP was a bore). The upcoming album, &#8220;We never sleep&#8221;, is described as &#8220;four-to-the-floor funk spiked with Grime and growling bass Techno, a fury of gritty club bangers dripping with romance and italo-punk attitude&#8221; by his label [Tigerbeat6][2]. You can listen to it [here][3], and even get the mp3&#8242;s if you&#8217;re [handy][4] with your browser&#8217;s cache. I didn&#8217;t figure him for a singer, but it&#8217;s all good, and you can watch his live act from the [Sonic Acts][5] festival at [Fabchannel][6]. The album should be available from [Dotshop][7] on May 27.
