I got to see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oststrand.de/oststrand_neu.html">Oststrand</a> this summer [anyway][1]! We had a beer with the ship&#8217;s cat at the Oststrand beach bar. See the [live mobile cam][2]. We&#8217;re now sitting at an italian-arabian restaurant called Mona Lisa, in Kreuzberg. Their omelette of the house was delicious. We kind of underestimated the time to get here from Stralsund on the cosy village roads. Even though arriving late, I got some nice music shopping done and to see some undiscovered territories. :) Tomorrow, we&#8217;re going to Potsdamer Platz to see the new holocaust memorial, and then head for Denmark I guess.
