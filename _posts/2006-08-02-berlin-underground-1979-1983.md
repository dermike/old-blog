I prefer the more electronic side of [NDW][1], but this compilation posted for download in the [WFMU][2] blog has some interesting songs from an [Einstürzende Neubauten][3] perspective:

> The person behind the moniker Borsig is actually 15 year old [Alexander Hacke][4] who later went on to join Einstürzende Neubauten.  
> &#8230;  
> Mania D was an all-women No Wave band with, among others, early Neubauten member [Gudrun Gut][5]. 

This home made [compilation][6], focusing on the year 1981, is more my cup of tea (via the [Dissensus][7] forum).
