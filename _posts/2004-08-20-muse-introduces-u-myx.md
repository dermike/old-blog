&#8220;Butterflies And Hurricanes&#8221; is the next single from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.muse.mu">Muse</a>. What&#8217;s special about this release is that it will feature a brand new concept in interactive audio mixing. An application called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.u-myx.com/">u-myx</a> will make it possible to remix &#8220;Butterflies And Hurricanes&#8221; without needing any specialist music skills or equipment. The mixes can be saved as either a tiny 4 kb u-myx file, ideal for sharing, or be exported as full audio to CD or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>. The format is the first ever to enable songs to be upgraded with new parts, such as vocal or instrumental contributions from other artists. If this is as cool as it sounds, it would really bring more value into buying singles/CDs.
