Saw <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/">Troy</a> yesterday! Wow! I&#8217;m very pleased with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000583/">Wolfgang Petersen&#8217;s</a> adaptation. Of course it has some annoying bits and flaws, but overall a very powerful och beautiful movie. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004051/">Brian Cox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051509/">Eric Bana</a> played fantastic as Agamemnon and Hector. I also liked the portrayal of Akilles and Briseis very much. A solid 4 out of 5!

Picked up our new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/x/xDSL.html">DSL</a> modem for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bostream.com/controller.php?action=scream">Bostream Scream</a> today. I measured the speed to 6 mbps which I guess is ok at this distance (4,5 km from the telestation).
