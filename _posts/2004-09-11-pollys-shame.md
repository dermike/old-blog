The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pjharvey.net">PJ Harvey</a> video I wrote about [earlier][1] (&#8220;You Come Through&#8221;) will be released on September 20, as part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www1.hmv.co.uk/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=280;-1;-1;-1&#038;sku=323507">DVD single</a> for &#8220;Shame&#8221;. Her video for &#8220;The Letter&#8221; will also be included. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www1.hmv.co.uk/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=280;-1;-1;-1&#038;sku=323506">CD single</a> features the b-side &#8220;97&#8243;. Yummy! She&#8217;s released one single every 2 months now from the album &#8220;Uh huh her&#8221;, this being the third. I wish more artists had that tempo.
