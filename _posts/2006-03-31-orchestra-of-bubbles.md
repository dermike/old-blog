The best electronic album of 2006 is soon here! &#8220;Orchestra Of Bubbles&#8221; by [Ellen Allien][1] and [Apparat][2] is a masterpiece in which their combined ways and sounds have created the most beautiful and fresh techno pop. It&#8217;s released on April 17, and you can listen to it at the [official][3] site. For you to learn more, I&#8217;ve also uploaded as much as I could fit from an interview on the latest [Slices][4] DVD magazine to YouTube. Watch it [here][5] and enjoy. Update: continues in [part 2][6].
