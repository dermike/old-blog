[Helvetica][1], love it or hate it, is the focus of a documentary film by Gary Hustwit about typography, graphic design and global visual culture. Featuring interviews with some of the most illustrious and innovative names in the design world, Gary himself answers the question of why he chose to make a film about a typeface:

> &#8220;Because it&#8217;s all around us. You&#8217;ve probably already seen Helvetica several times today. I guess I just wondered, &#8220;Why?&#8221; How did a typeface drawn by a little-known Swiss designer in 1957 become one of the most popular ways for us to communicate our words fifty years later?&#8221;

The [sans-serif][2] will celebrate it&#8217;s 50th birthday in 2007 and the film, currently in post-production, is slated to begin screening at film festivals worldwide early next year. I&#8217;m already drooling&#8230;
