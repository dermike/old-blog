I&#8217;m amazed. [This guy][1] has posted a leaked version of [Fiona Apple&#8217;s][2] &#8220;Extraordinary Machine&#8221; album in his blog. Try her if you don&#8217;t know her. She&#8217;s simply great! I&#8217;m guessing [Jon Brion][3] is the producer as always. [Sony][4] doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s radio-friendly, so this might be your only chance.
