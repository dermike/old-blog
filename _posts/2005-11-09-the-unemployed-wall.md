Today, 16 years ago, the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall">Berlin Wall</a> fell. To celebrate it, I uploaded a little sketch from the now discontinued <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ankelatenight.de">Anke Late Night</a> TV show. Originally made for the 50 year anniversary of the founding of DDR, it&#8217;s about the unemployed Berlin Wall today! :) German speech, but don&#8217;t let that scare you. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/temp/unemployedwall.wmv">Watch it here</a> (Windows media).
