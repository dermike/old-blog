Whee! Grim Reaper Georgia is back for another season with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deadlikeme.tv">Dead Like Me</a>! I just watched the first episode, and it overwhelmed me! I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s back! :) ([Here&#8217;s][1] my previous post about it.) Just what I needed after my first day back at the office. I was told that &#8220;P&#8221; has left the company, it didn&#8217;t quite &#8220;work out&#8221;. :/ That&#8217;s too bad.. He was a nice guy.. Who am I gonna discuss music with now? Frankly, I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s working out either.. I need a more stable work. Commission and lack of stuff to do is not the best combination if you want to get your own place to live.  
Anyone got a job to offer me? :)
