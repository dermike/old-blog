I sooooo wanna see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madonna.com">Madonna&#8217;s</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madonnalicious.com/press_reviews.html">Re-Invention Tour</a> which opened in L.A. yesterday! It seems to have gotten great reviews almost everywhere!

> &#8220;The powerful footage dominated long sections of the show &#8211; including during Madonna&#8217;s cover of John Lennon&#8217;s Imagine. When Lennon&#8217;s photo was flashed on the screen, the audience erupted. &#8220;

No show is confirmed for Sweden&#8230; yet, but I doubt it will happen this time. I hope it will be released on DVD at least, which probably is a no as well. Read somewhere that she&#8217;s focusing on a behind the scenes-documentary.
