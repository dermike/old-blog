Oh, how I miss [Hint Hint][1]&#8230; Every time their awesome &#8220;Sex Is Everything&#8221; EP comes up random in iTunes, I check their site, but no news. Only some old, unfinished and unreleased recordings, which might mean they split up. There&#8217;s a [Myspace][2] page at least, where you can get some of the goodies. Any hints or clues?
