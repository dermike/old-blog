A sad day. My favourite talkshow, <a target="_blank" href="http://ankelatenight.sat1.d">Anke Late Night</a> at german <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sat1.de">SAT1</a>, was broadcast for the last time yesterday (Streaming today at the homepage). :( Led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anke-engelke.de">Anke Engelke</a>, the only female late night talkshow host in the world, the SAT1 executives wasn&#8217;t very happy with the response from the target group.. or something like that, so they decided to shut it down. If you want to catch a climpse of it, I uploaded a little sketch about Britney Spear&#8217;s wedding night (In english). Watch it [here][1] (Windows media).
