Both a trick and a treat, the north american indie elite (The Arcade Fire, Sonic Youth, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Peaches among others) teamed up to record &#8220;Do They Know It&#8217;s Halloween&#8221;. A satire charity-benefit song with all proceeds being donated to UNICEF. See the full credits and listen to it [here][1]&#8230; and of course buy it on October 11 (available as download a week before). :)
