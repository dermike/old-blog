Just listened through the first album from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leaveseyes.de">Leaves Eyes</a>, and I must say I&#8217;m positively surprised.

> Leaves Eyes is a new band of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.livkristine.de/start.htm">Liv Kristine</a> Espenaes Krull, former lead singer of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatreoftragedy.com/">Theatre Of Tragedy</a>, and the members of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atrocity.de/">Atrocity</a>. The music of Leaves Eyes is based on the wonderful voice of Liv and beautiful melodic arrangements.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/">Troy</a> premieres tomorrow. I have some mixed feelings about it. I loved the greek mythology when I was younger, but a movie like this&#8230; I&#8217;m sceptic. Haven&#8217;t been to the movies for months now. I suppose it&#8217;s time for another visit. Tomorrow is BBQ night over at boss&#8217; place though.
