I&#8217;ve been a sucker for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anidealactress.com/">Julianne Moore</a> ever since I saw <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/">Magnolia</a>. Today <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323033/">Laws Of Attraction</a> opened at Swedish theatres in which she plays a divorce attourney competing against another played by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000112/">Pierce Brosnan</a>, who this movie was especially written for. It&#8217;s a romantic comedy where they end up in a relationship, but can they avoid the same issues at home that lead people to provide them business at work?  
Not being able to resist the charm of either Julianne or Pierce, I really enjoyed this movie. It&#8217;s good entertainment for about 90 minutes, but definately not the kind that stays with you though.
