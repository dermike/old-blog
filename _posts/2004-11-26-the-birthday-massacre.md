They&#8217;re the new soundtrack of my winter darkness. I&#8217;m glad I discovered <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nothingandnowhere.com/">The Birthday Massacre</a> on this month&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.orkus-online.de">Orkus</a> sampler. Post-retro electronic gothic popish rock with great euphoric melodies. A nice and unique sound when everyone else want to sound like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.evanescence.com/">Evanescence</a> (read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.within-temptation.com/">Within Temptation</a>). They sure know how to market themselves online. I hate it when you can&#8217;t listen to bands on their websites. No problem here, their website is even available in Swedish, and most other European languages. :) Don&#8217;t miss &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221;.
