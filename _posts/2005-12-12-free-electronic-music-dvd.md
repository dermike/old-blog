Issue 4 of [Slices][1], the free DVD format electronic music magazine, is out in a few days. Their big feature this time is [Modeselektor][2], which I just can&#8217;t miss. Ok, so I lied a little when I wrote it&#8217;s free&#8230; If you can&#8217;t pick it up yourself at any of the [stores][3] offering it (mainly in Germany and the UK), you have to pay for postage and packing. Instead of an 8â‚¬ international bank transfer, you can get it from [Juno][4], where the shipping is cheaper.. but you&#8217;ll also have to order something else from there of course. My recommendation would be the new album from dutch drum&#8217;n bass collective, [Black Sun Empire][5].
