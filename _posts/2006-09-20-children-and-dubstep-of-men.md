Pinch me, am I dreaming? &#8220;[Children of men][1]&#8221; definately looks and sounds like the movie of the year to me! Dubstep music and [Julianne Moore][2] in a sci-fi movie? Almost too good to be true, but apparently requested by director [Alfonso Cuar√≥n][3] who was intrested in this new sound. Great [tracks][4], although in the background, and a great director.. can&#8217;t go wrong?
