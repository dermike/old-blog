Alexander Hacke, the bassist of [Einst√ºrzende Neubauten][1], sets out to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul in [Fatih Akin&#8217;s][2] new documentary, [&#8220;Crossing The Bridge&#8221;][3]. His previous drama, [&#8220;Head-On&#8221;][4], is one of my absolute favourites and I can&#8217;t wait to lay my hand on this new DVD, featuring a voyage through modern electronic, rock and hip-hop to classical &#8220;Arabesque&#8221;. Apart from the [trailers][5], Intro magazine have also put up some [clips][6] from it.
