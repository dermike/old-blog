The server redvolume.com is on was hacked during xmas. Hopefully [Pentry][1] has secured the server now (The reason why it&#8217;s been going up and down). [So far][2], this is the only problem I&#8217;ve had with them. Guess something had to happen once at least. <img src="http://188.226.203.75/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
