Even though the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/postercontest/">Resident Evil: Apocalypse Poster Contest</a> is open for US residents only, I couldn&#8217;t hold myself from putting together a piece. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=4&#038;pos=0">Click here</a> to see it. I&#8217;m not that pleased with the result, but I&#8217;ll see if anyone can compete with it for me&#8230; always worth a shot. :) 

Update:  
From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yukio.se/blog/">Sanna&#8217;s</a> comments, I tried making another version. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=4&#038;pos=1">See it here</a>.  
The fuzzy background symbolizes the chaotic zombie riot which I&#8217;m guessing will take place in the movie. :)
