I&#8217;ve been waking up sweaty several nights now, probably from the increasing spring warmth, with all sorts of dreamy visions. One time I though something was flowing from the walls. Had to turn on the light just to make sure it wasn&#8217;t. :P Last night I found out what was causing it though&#8230; The pulsating stand-by lamp from my [Ibook][1]. :) Talk about [ghost in the machine][2] (ghost.3gp) . It&#8217;s gonna have to face the other wall from now on&#8230;
