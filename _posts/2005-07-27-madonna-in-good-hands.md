The title and producer of the first single from [Madonna&#8217;s][1] new album, &#8220;Confessions on a Dancefloor&#8221;, have been revealed! Stuart Price aka [Jacques Lu Cont][2] aka Thin White Duke put his magic touch on &#8220;Hung Up&#8221;, which is to be released this fall. She couldn&#8217;t have picked a better producer for it, but let&#8217;s hope this isn&#8217;t the only track on the album he&#8217;s behind! ..I wonder where the [rock sound][3] rumour came from?
