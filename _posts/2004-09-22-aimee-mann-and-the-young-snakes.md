A visit to the Aimee Mann <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aimeemann.com/messageboard/">messageboard</a> always pays. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aimeemann.com/messageboard/viewthread.php?tid=3276">This thread</a> reports that an album with her first band ever, The Young Snakes, will be reissued on CD in the UK. :) 

> &#8220;I was this 18-year-old in crisis. What was I going to do with my life? I didn&#8217;t know anything about music.&#8221;

..is how Aimee remembers it according to the archives of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aimeemanninprint.com/">Aimee Mann in print</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.citypaper.net/articles/011702/mus.cds4.shtml">this</a> is what citypaper.net think about the original vinyl ep. I&#8217;m excited. :)
