After a pretty smooth ride, I&#8217;m here at my grandparents in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nassjo.se">Nässjö</a>. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=147&#038;a=286011&#038;previousRenderType=6">massive rain flooding</a> in Småland didn&#8217;t affect us.. not yet at least. :P We only had some rain and fog while driving, which was kind of cosy while listening to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neilyoung.com/">Neil Young&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Harvest&#8221;. If I should ever sing karaoke, I think I&#8217;d choose to sing &#8220;Out On The Weekend&#8221; from that album. :) We also listened to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/sommar/host.asp?date=2004-07-10">Fredrik Lindström&#8217;s chronicle</a> on radio P1. Pretty good. Listen to it online if you missed it. He kind of made me understand what <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raymondochmaria.se/">Raymond & Maria&#8217;s</a> song was all about, but I&#8217;ve already forgotten. ;)
Dad has as good as agreed to drive to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a> since we didn&#8217;t really find anything exciting on the map of the north coast&#8230; Wheee! *&#8220;Ich hab&#8217; noch einen Koffer in Berlin&#8230;lalalala..&#8221;* as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundslikemarlene.de/">Marlene Dietrich</a> sang. :)
