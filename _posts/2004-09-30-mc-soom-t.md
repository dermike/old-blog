I&#8217;ve heard her on several tracks now from both <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scape-music.de">Bus</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theorb.com/">The Orb</a>. A background check leads me to the Glasgow formation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monkeytribe.net">Monkeytribe</a>, dedicated to the underground aspects of hiphop. She&#8217;s from Glasgow, been rapping since &#8217;98 and was crowned Scotland&#8217;s best MC and the UK&#8217;s best female MC in 2003! Sings really good too&#8230; Hope she will do some more stuff with the guys from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a>, or maybe even with my house hero Armand van Helden, who she lists as an influence. :) Don&#8217;t miss the free <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monkeytribe.net/tunespage.htm">downloads</a>.
