&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.relive.se">ReLive</a> is a music service acting as a link between music lovers and live music.&#8221; I guess this is kind of what I requested in my post about [podcasting][1]. Streaming club music directly in your 3G phone. 10 sek for 24 hours, or 39 for a month at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tre.se">Tre</a>. Listening to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.outputrecordings.com/">DK7</a>, the project of Jesper Dahlb√§ck and Irish born singer songwriter Mark O'Sullivan, I must say I&#8217;m impressed. :) Only bad thing I can think of at the moment must be the battery drainage.
