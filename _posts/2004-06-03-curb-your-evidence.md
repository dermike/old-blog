My all time favourite comedian, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hbo.com/larrydavid/">Larry David</a>, saved a man from possible death penalty. ESPN.com reports that the accused, Juan Catalan, found his alibi in unused video footage of LD&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hbo.com/larrydavid/">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a> show.

> The show was hardly about the ballpark crowd that night. It focused on David hiring a prostitute, not for sex but to be a passenger in his car so he could travel in the carpool lane and escape traffic on his way to the stadium.
