&#8220;You don&#8217;t have a chance &#8211; take it&#8221; was the tagline for [Pusher][1]. One of the best films ever, made by Danish director <Nicolas Winding Refn>. A dark, raw and almost documentary journey into the (under)world of Copenhagen drug dealer Frank.  
I&#8217;ve been expecting a sequel for a long time (and a [trilogy][2]?), but now it&#8217;s finally here! [Pusher 2][3]. This time about Frank&#8217;s previous companion Tonny (I&#8217;m gonna miss [Kim Bodnia][4]). It premieres in Denmark on December 25th. I&#8217;m hoping it won&#8217;t be much longer until it reaches Sweden. Trailer and more info available at the [official site][3].
