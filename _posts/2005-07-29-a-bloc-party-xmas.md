&#8220;Oh my God I can&#8217;t believe it&#8221;, but [rumour][1] has it that [Bloc Party][2] and [Kaiser Chiefs][3] are planning to release a joint christmas single this year!

> &#8220;We talked about doing a festive single with Bloc Party, like a sort of limited-edition cover&#8221; -Nick Baines from the Kaisers

A cover of Mariah Carey&#8217;s &#8220;All I Want For Christmas Is You&#8221; is apparently under consideration. This project would certainly at least lift my christmas spirit. :)
