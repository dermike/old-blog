It&#8217;s the last day of my vacation, so I thought it would be a good idea to watch some movies I haven&#8217;t had time to see yet. I decided to give <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/">Kill Bill</a> another chance, the japanese edition in full colour. And right after that&#8230; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/">Kill Bill vol. 2</a> which I haven&#8217;t seen yet. I&#8217;m not a big fan of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/">Mr. Tarantino</a>, except from his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119396/">Jackie Brown</a>, which I love. :) I&#8217;ll update with an opinion here later&#8230;

Vol. 1 is still asian crap in my opinion. It didn&#8217;t give me anything. Luckily, Vol 2 is better. Not as hysteric and overdriven. I really liked how the story turned out, and how the good parts of Vol 1 was further explained. A solid 3/5 as a whole, but I&#8217;ll probably just skip directly to Vol 2 next time.. I&#8217;m pretty sure I will watch it again.
