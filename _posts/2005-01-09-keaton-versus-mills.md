Buster Keaton&#8217;s first feature film [Three Ages][1] from 1923 has been digitally restored, with a new soundtrack by techno pioneer [Jeff Mills][2]! It&#8217;s released by [MK2][3] on DVD where you also get Jeff&#8217;s new score on a separate CD. Read more about it [here][4]. I normally wouldn&#8217;t care about silent films, but since it&#8217;s Mr. Mills, I just gotta see this. :)
