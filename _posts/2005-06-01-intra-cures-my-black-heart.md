Somewhat depressed from missing [Ron Sexsmith&#8217;s][1] free gig over at [Debaser][2], I instantly got in a better mood when finding out that [Ram-Zet&#8217;s][3] third album, &#8220;Intra&#8221; is finally out! I&#8217;m a sucker for female voices in metal, and in this case especially the schizophrenic soundscapes, mixing beautiful ethereal melodies and voices with industrial rage and aggressive guitar riffs. :)  
I also found the reason behind the sudden disappearance of [Disco Volante&#8217;s][4] &#8220;Black Heart&#8221; single ([Video][5]). A dispute between the band and their former manager prevents it from reaching the stores. Can be bought through their homepage for now though. :)
