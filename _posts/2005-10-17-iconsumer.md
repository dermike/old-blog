I really hate being this way, but when [Apple][1] presented their new [iMac][2], I just knew it was the thing to trade in my iBook for (on auction [here][3]). It&#8217;s basically more power I need, so there might even be something better coming on the [press event][4] this Wednesday. Hopefully I will get it sold in time before [&#8220;Buy nothing christmas&#8221;][5]. Sometimes it&#8217;s hard being a bad consumer.
