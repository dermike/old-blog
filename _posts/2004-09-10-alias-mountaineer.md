After a really intense working week, I&#8217;ve started my <a target="_blank" href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/">Alias</a> Season 3 marathon. As much as I found the ending of season 2 unpleasant, I loved the beginning of this new season, just released on DVD. :) They&#8217;ve made some improvements on the menus. Much better looking! I tried watching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004950/">Jennifer Garner</a> in &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337563/">13 Going On 30</a>&#8221; a while back, but I&#8217;m really having trouble seeing her in another role than <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alias-tv.com/sydney.html">Sydney Bristow</a>. :)
