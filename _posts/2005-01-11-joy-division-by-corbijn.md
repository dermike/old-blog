A movie about Ian Curtis and [Joy Division][1] has been rumoured for years. Now it looks like it&#8217;s finally [coming][2], and with passion! It will be the directional debut of photographer [Anton Corbijn][3], and produced by Factory Records founder Anthony Wilson. Wow! But remember.. If bad, we can&#8217;t blame it on Hollywood. :P
