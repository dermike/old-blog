I&#8217;ve just started watching the really unique <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deadlikeme.tv">Dead Like Me</a> tv series.

> For Georgia Lass, life is boring. With a dreary day job and a tepid family life, the typically grim 20-year old suspects that she must be destined for something more&#8230; stimulating. She&#8217;s right, of course, though she could have scarcely suspected that destiny would take the form of an errant scrap of Soviet plumbing. She discovers that the afterlife does indeed exist, where she has been assigned a job as a &#8216;Reaper.&#8217; It&#8217;s her job to reap the souls from the living and guide them to their eternal reward. Besides coping with her new job, she must learn to deal with being young and starting out &#8211; and of course, being dead.

Dark humor and refreshing views of life and death. It will be interesting to see how long they can keep it up. A second season is on it&#8217;s way. Recommended! :)
