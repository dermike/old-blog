Up. Down. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Down. It actually took a while until I accepted the fact that my [webhosting][1] provider was simply incompetent. Now on a new server (Thanks to [Svante][2]!) I will try to reclaim my online life, which has suffered a lot. Some of the latest stuff is missing because of not being able to backup during this time. I also took the opportunity to upgrade to [WordPress][3] 1.5.1.1.
