My aunt and uncle from Australia are here visiting, and he gave me this demo DVD from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cofa.unsw.edu.au">COFA</a>, College of fine arts at the university of New South Wales in Sydney, where he works. The DVD showcases lot&#8217;s of nice work by students in visual arts, design and digital media. I haven&#8217;t watched the info stuff yet, but it seems like a really good school. Check it out if you&#8217;re thinking of studying any of the above, or art education and art history. I will. :)
