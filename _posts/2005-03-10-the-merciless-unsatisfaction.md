&#8220;The Merciless Beauty&#8221; is the name of [Fidget&#8217;s][1] second album. I love [their first][2], but I&#8217;m not sure what to think of this new one. They&#8217;ve somehow let all kinds of influences take control and left out most of what I liked from before. The new calmer and atmospheric sound is not bad, but it leaves me kind of unsatisfied. Skate fashion store [Titus][3] is hosting a free download of &#8220;Better Than This&#8221; from the album (one of the more conservative tracks). Here&#8217;s a [direct link][4] to it for those who&#8217;s curious.
