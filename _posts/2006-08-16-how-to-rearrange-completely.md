I&#8217;d say my relationship with [Radiohead][1] is pretty normal. I think they&#8217;ve made some amazing songs, the perfect album opener with &#8220;Everything In Its Right Place&#8221;, and that they will have no problem to live on forever with all this love:

[Skeet Spirit][2], a crunk tribute to Radiohead. Instrumentals by DJ Gyngvytus. Don&#8217;t miss &#8220;The National Headbustaz Anthem&#8221;!

[Rockabye Baby][3], lullaby renditions of Radiohead. &#8220;Sophisticated enough for people of all ages, but sweet enough to introduce your child to rock's smartest band&#8221;.
