I finally took the time to get my [Mobile Cam Archive][1] together. Instead of the boring directory listing, I fixed the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/">SimpleViewer</a>, made in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Flash</a>, to interact with my archive. :) Thanks for the help with those <a target="_blank" href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> arrays <a target="_blank" href="http://www.campkongo.se">Daniel</a>! An RSS-feed and permalinks are coming&#8230; Probably later today. :) 

Update:  
RSS and permalinks are ready. A super-duper-thanks to John for helping me with the page divider scripting!
