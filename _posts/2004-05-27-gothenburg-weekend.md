It&#8217;s all set. I&#8217;m going to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goteborg.com/">Gothenburg</a> tomorrow. Train leaves at 19:10. Down there is the staff meeting/party for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dvdforum.se">dvdforum.se</a>. I have just recently resigned as a moderator, but I was invited to take part of it anyway. Guess it will be fun to meet the others, but most of all to see Walle and Sethp (to whom I passed on my mission). :) I&#8217;ve been told we&#8217;re all gonna see <nobr><a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/">The Day After Tomorrow</a></nobr>. Let&#8217;s just hope it&#8217;s better than I can imagine. I&#8217;ll try to update the mobile cam as often as I can, but that&#8217;s no promise. :P
