<a target="_blank" href="http://www.loveparade.de">Loveparade</a> might return to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a> in 2005! The preparations are in full motion according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dn.se">DN</a>! No date has yet been set, and there&#8217;s no news about it on the official site so far. Since the sponsors let them down [this year][1], I&#8217;m guessing they don&#8217;t want to make a premature announcement. I&#8217;m keeping my thumbs crossed! :)
