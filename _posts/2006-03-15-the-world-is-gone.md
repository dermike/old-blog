It was pretty obvious that the track called &#8220;The world is gone&#8221;, played on this week&#8217;s [Breezeblock][1], is made by the very secretive [Various Production][2] team&#8230; but what about the vocals? At first I though it was [Beth Orton][3], but it turns out these guys sampled [Cat Power][4] from the song &#8220;Great Waves&#8221; she did together with [Dirty Three][5]. Amazing track nevertheless, can&#8217;t wait for the album they&#8217;re supposed to drop this summer!
