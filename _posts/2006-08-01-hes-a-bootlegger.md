He&#8217;s bootleggin&#8217; the music, baby! Sorry, I can&#8217;t keep myself from doing [Seinfeld][1] references. [Mark Vidler][2], or Go Home Productions, is the UK&#8217;s finest bootleg mash-up remixer. He was recently featured on BBC&#8217;s [Blue Room][3] show, and that 20 minute mix is now available for [download][4]. I&#8217;m not a big fan of [mash-up&#8217;s][5], but when it&#8217;s this nicely done I can&#8217;t help being impressed.
