I think I need to put myself on an ice tea free diet. I suspect I have some light version of kidney stones. The reason to all this is probably all the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.funlight.se">Fun Light</a> Ice Tea I&#8217;ve been drinking lately. You mix it with water like juice, and it&#8217;s sugar free. :) Tastes great, but try not to overdose it&#8230; maybe I&#8217;m just hypochondriac. :P
