Sweet nostalgia. :) For some reason, I got the desire to play the old <a target="_blank" href="http://www.3drealms.com/wacky/">Wacky Wheels</a> game by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fact-index.com/a/ap/apogee_games.html">Apogee</a>. I used to love that game back in 1994, especially the deathmatch multiplayer mode. I found the full version of it <a target="_blank" href="http://wackywheels.wz.cz/">here</a>, but to play it, you will also need a DOS emulator. <a target="_blank" href="http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/">Dosbox</a> did the trick. Only thing missing now is some kind of null modem emulator so I can play it over the internet. I hope <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gold-software.com/download4684.html">VSPD.net</a> will work. If not, the game at least has split screen mode. Phil&#8217;s got a nice <a target="_blank" href="http://www.maddogcarter.com/phil/wacky_wheels/">fanpage</a> for it.  
Update: VSPD didn&#8217;t seem to work.. any help appreciated!
