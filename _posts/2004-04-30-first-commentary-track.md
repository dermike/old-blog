Wow.. I just listened to a complete commentary track on DVD for the first time. :) I haven&#8217;t really felt the urge before, but the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deadlikeme.tv">Dead Like Me</a> series really affected me. (Yes I know I&#8217;m nagging :)). I watched it like I described <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/archives/2004/04/23/spooks_marathon">here</a>.  
The track was great to listen to. All of the main cast were discussing their thoughts and ideas through the whole pilot episode. They had some cool ideas for the future of the series, although some were perhaps a little too enthusiastic. It was a very good platform for expanding your own thoughts and I&#8217;m sure it will keep me occupied a while, figuring stuff out. That&#8217;s really what defines a good movie or a series for me. It should stick to you after you&#8217;ve watched it.  
Just go get yours of this now, I insist! :)
