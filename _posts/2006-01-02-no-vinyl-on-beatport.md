A lot of music I want is only available on vinyl, and when using [iTunes][1] for playing all my music there&#8217;s just too much work getting it in there. For the latest EP from [Evol Intent][2] I decided to try the [Beatport][3] digital music store. Focusing on electronic music, they offer MP3 (320 kbps), MP4 (192 kbps VBR) or WAV format on a pay per download basis. Not quite as smooth and easy as the iTunes music store, it was still a nice experience. Most labels and artists I searched for was there, so I will definately return. Cheaper than the real 12 inch and flawless digital copies without DRM protection. Can&#8217;t wait for [Juno][4] to get their digital apartment up and running.
