&#8220;You&#8217;re ahead of your time and it&#8217;s killing you!&#8221;, is what <a target="_blank" href="http://www.50footwave.com/">50 Foot Wave</a> was told by the labels and promoters on their European tour. Their plan to release 5-6 song recordings every 9 months has not been taken seriously by either retail, radio or the press. In consultation with both their European and US partners, they decided to release a full-length CD in February 2005, which will include 3 remixed songs taken from their first mini album. I really hope they will keep trying this new concept. I love EP&#8217;s, and would rather have releases in shorter intervals. It works for fans, why not the industry?
