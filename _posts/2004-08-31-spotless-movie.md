I couldn&#8217;t find anything I didn&#8217;t like about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>. I was very sceptic about seeing it at first, but I&#8217;m really glad I did. It proved to me that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/">Jim Carrey</a> can actually act. I&#8217;m definately not a fan of his comedy, so I hope he&#8217;ll be doing more of this stuff instead in the future. I&#8217;m also glad to see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442109/">Charlie Kaufman</a> shape up a nice script again after the, in my opinion, very crappy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/">Adaptation</a>. Two bonuses.. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000701/">Kate Winslet</a> with red hair and a nice cover version of &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s Gotta Learn Sometimes&#8221; sung by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beck.com">Beck</a>. :9 So don&#8217;t miss this one!
