We&#8217;ll see how long it takes before I break. [Cerys Matthews][1], ex [Catatonia][2] singer, release her second solo album on August 21. I&#8217;ll gladly wait for it, no problem, it&#8217;s the first single I want, now and badly! It&#8217;s called &#8220;Open Roads&#8221; and contains a cover of [Bowie&#8217;s][3] &#8220;Soul Love&#8221;, which it&#8217;s now all about after hearing the sample on [Juno][4]. Why does it have to be so short and cut right before the chorus? If it&#8217;s not on iTunes, I&#8217;ll have to jump off the balcony&#8230; [Luckily][5] it was.
