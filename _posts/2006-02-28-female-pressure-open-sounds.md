The first compilation from [Female Pressure&#8217;s][1] project, [Open Sounds][2], will be released on March 21 as a free CD. Electro ladies from Vienna (homebase of the organization) are first out to &#8220;raise the visibility of female creations in the seemingly male dominated fields of electronic music&#8221;. Not sure how the CD will be distributed, but it will hopefully also be available to download since the whole project goes under a free to share [Creative Commons][3] license.
