No more <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000112/">Pierce Brosnan</a> playing Commander <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jamesbond.com/"> James Bond</a>. :( I thought he was gonna do one more movie, but apparently that&#8217;s not the case anymore.

He was definately my &#8220;favourite Bond&#8221;. I really hope he changes his mind when looking at the list of possible replacements.. Gerard Butler, Jude Law, Ewan McGregor, Hugh Jackman.. and Orlando Bloom.. Please.. I&#8217;m eating here. :P
