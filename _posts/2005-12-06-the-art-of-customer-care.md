..and the winner is [CD Baby.com][1]:

&#8220;Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.

A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it was in the best possible condition before mailing.

Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.

We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved &#8216;Bon Voyage!&#8217; to your package, on its way to you, in our private CD Baby jet on this day, Monday, December 5th.

I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did. Your picture is on our wall as &#8216;Customer of the Year&#8217;. We&#8217;re all exhausted but can&#8217;t wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!&#8221;
