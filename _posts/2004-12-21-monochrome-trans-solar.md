While cleaning up my mailbox a little, I found an old mail where I asked if [Elektrolochmann][1] had any distribution in Sweden. They didn&#8217;t at the moment. Checking back, the Berlin based label [Trans Solar][2] is now distributed by [Border][3]. :) I had no idea that TS released The ([International][4]) Noise Conspiracy&#8217;s debut 7&#8243;, but more importantly I discovered [Monochrome][5]!

> &#8220;Combining the intensity of punk with the easiness of Scandinavia Pop and the profundity of jazz, Monochrome have their unique and distinctive identity&#8221;

The [sample][6] mp3 really got me hooked, and since [Hotstuff.se][7] generally sucks (I can&#8217;t even get on their site right now), I&#8217;m gonna try order from [X-mist][8] instead&#8230;
