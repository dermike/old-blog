Germany&#8217;s new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bundespraesident.de/">president</a> for the next 5 years is Horst Köhler, who won the election against Gesine Schwan. Just like the swedish king, the president have no real political power and is not to be confused with the Bundeskansler. The president&#8217;s job is basically to represent the republic internationally.  
We&#8217;ll see how it goes. Not considering their agendas, I think I would&#8217;ve preferred Gesine in this case. A top woman is not as dull as a former economist. The sexual equality really needs a push in Germany.
