Me and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carlaberatio.com">Tobbe</a> went up early today to catch the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcdonalds.se/Sweden/Prodfacts.nsf/wwwDisplay/312EBF2D069C7902C1256EB50062DE42!OpenDocument">McDonalds breakfast</a> before 11. Complemented my record collection with 2 classics, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pattismith.net/">Patti Smith&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Horses&#8221; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.depechemode.com/">Depeche Mode&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Ultra&#8221;. 2 for 99 at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.expert.se/">Expert</a>. :) We were supposed to have some coffee with Martin, but when we called he was so hung over/busy, so we spent the rest of the day listening to some dub. We also managed to track down the great track we heard at [The Olsson Brothers][1] Garlic & Shots bar. &#8220;The Marvels &#8211; Rock Steady&#8221;. Ended up with rain, rain, rain and no coffee.
