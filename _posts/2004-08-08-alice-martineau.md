As my internet connection was down most of the day, I sat out on the porch reading while listening to some old mix-cd&#8217;s that was lying around. Suddenly [Alice Martineau&#8217;s][1] &#8220;The Right Time&#8221; got on.. A great pop track which I&#8217;m guessing is produced by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep98/articles/mariusdevries.html">Marius De Vries</a> because of the beautifully programmed electronic elements. It oozes the vibes of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madonna.com">Madonna&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Ray of Light&#8221; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.williamorbit.com/">William Orbit</a>, which isn&#8217;t that surprising since Marius was involved in the making of that album too. :) The sad thing about Alice, apart from the rest of her album being kind of dull, is that she died from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cff.org/">Cystic Fibrosis</a> last year, 30 years old, not long after her album was released. This post is in her honour. &#8220;The Right Time&#8221; will at least live on with me.
