[Grimestep International][1] is an upcoming documentary DVD focusing on the development of grime and dubstep scenes beyond London, where grime is almost declared [dead][2]. It&#8217;s cooking in the rest of Europe though, and with it&#8217;s main focus on Berlin, you&#8217;ll get interviews with [Matt Shadetek][3], the [Grimetime][4] crew and [Sick Girls][5]. Big stars from London such as [Skream][6], Dizzee Rascal and Sway are all interviewed on the road while also checking out Brussels, Copenhagen, Lisbon and Paris. The DVD should be out somtime in September, and there&#8217;s already a volume 2 planned for North America and Asia. I&#8217;m guessing [Goth-Trad][7] will be on that one. For more info listen in on the latest GT [podcast][8]&#8230;

I&#8217;ll be checking out Brussels myself on September 8th! [Sub Stance][9] at Aman Caf√© with [N-Type][10] and [Walsh][11] from London.
