Things like this kind of freak me out. [Aimee Mann][1] has just finished recording a christmas album due out this fall. &#8220;One More Drifter In The Snow&#8221; features some of the usual holiday classics plus an original Aimee song, and one by [Michael Penn][2]. It&#8217;s probably the last thing I expected from her, and I&#8217;m not sure I want this, but hopefully there&#8217;s a good reason for making it. Better start preparing my collection for it&#8217;s first xmas disc&#8230;

For more Aimee freakyness, check out the [ANS remix][3] version of &#8220;Wise Up&#8221;.
