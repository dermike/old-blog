More remixes&#8230; On October 25th, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mute.com">Mute</a> will release what they call &#8220;The Ultimate Remix Album&#8221;. A 2-disc set spanning over 20 years of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.depechemode.com">Depeche Mode</a> remixes. Titled &#8220;Remixes 81-04&#8243;, the compilation will include a brand new remix of &#8220;Halo&#8221; by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goldfrapp.co.uk/">Goldfrapp</a>, &#8220;Barrel Of A Gun&#8221; by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.underworldanthology.com/">Underworld</a>, &#8220;Home&#8221; remixed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intairnet.org/">Air</a> and a new mix of &#8220;Enjoy The Silence&#8221; by Linkin Park&#8217;s Mike Shinoda. I&#8217;ll probably just get the new &#8220;ETS&#8221; single though, which is to be released one week before the album. I&#8217;ve heard the old mixes to my death, and it seems the single will include most of the new stuff anyway. See the details over at the <a target="_blank" href="http://remixes8104.depechemode.com/">official site</a>.
