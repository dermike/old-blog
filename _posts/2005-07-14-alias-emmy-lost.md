The nominations for the 2005 [Emmy Awards][1] are announced! [Alias][2] is nominated in 4 categories, each one as exciting as the fourth season itself:

> Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series; [Jennifer Garner][3] as Sydney Bristow  
> Outstanding Costumes for a Series  
> Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series  
> Outstanding Stunt Coordination

Since [Mr Abrams][4] apparently was more caught up with [Lost][5], his other series which is nominated in 8 categories, Jennifer can probably kiss that Emmy goodbye. Taking a closer look at the Costumes category, which is obviously Alias&#8217; specialty (they&#8217;ve made that perfectly clear in the new intro for season 4), [Deadwood][6] is probably the only real challenger. Call me bitter, but I seriously doubt there will be a single Emmy awarded to the Alias team. Please Mr Abrams, you need to focus on one show at a time, and try not to mix up the scripts again. We deserve better.
