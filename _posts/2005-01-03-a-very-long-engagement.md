I totally [missed][1] there was a new movie with [Audrey Tautou][2]! The [trailer][3] looks good and all, but it leaves me feeling kind of empty. I could probably blame it on that awful american narrators voice though. My confidence in monsieur [Jeunet][4] is almost unlimited after [Amelie][5]. Guess I don&#8217;t have to worry about my plans for January 28th now. :) Read more about it at [imdb][6].
