..the real movies? The joy from getting a pair of movie tickets at [SF][1] didn&#8217;t last very long. Looking at their coming attractions, there&#8217;s absolutely nothing I feel like watching for months. Where did they find all that crap? There&#8217;s one movie though, that I&#8217;ve actually been looking forward to. The new [Julianne Moore][2] movie, [The Forgotten][3]&#8230; but I&#8217;m thinking of getting it on DVD from [Swedisc][4] instead since it&#8217;s released about the same time as the Swedish premiere. Recommendations anyone?
