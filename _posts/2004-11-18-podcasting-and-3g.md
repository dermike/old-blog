I&#8217;ve recently discovered how cool <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">podcasts</a> can be. :) Since most new cellphones have audio playback capability today, I could probably use mine to open up my <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAP">WAP</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>-reader and download (stream?) the latest listening pleasure from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.steffanie.net/blog">Steffanie</a> for example. It would be perfect for those boring bus rides into town! The only thing stopping me is the price.  
A 20 minute mp3 encoded as mono, in 32 kbps 16 kHz is about 5 mb. That would end up as almost 9 euros on my phonebill at the end of the month. Since I&#8217;m a realist, I think we&#8217;re a long way from data flatrate in the 3G networks, but my suggestion to the operators is this&#8230; Why not create a service where users have free download, from let&#8217;s say a limited number of favourite feeds, for just a smaller monthly fee? Something like those subscription services currently available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.three.co.uk">Three</a>. I&#8217;m pretty sure that it would attract a lot of bloggers to leave GSM behind. :)
