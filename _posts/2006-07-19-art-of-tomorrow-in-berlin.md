I was lucky enough to catch the [&#8220;Art Of Tomorrow&#8221;][1] exhibition at [Guggenheim][2] Berlin before it&#8217;s ending on August 10. It features the amazing non-objective art of and encouraged by [Hilla Rebay][3], who helped establish the Guggenheim museum in New York, now honoured with this exhibition. Her paper collages are to die for and have that perfect sense of forms and space I love. Not to miss if you&#8217;re nearby&#8230;
