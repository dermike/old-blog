<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pjharvey.net">PJ Harvey</a> releases her new single &#8220;You Come Through&#8221; this week. The date seem to be uncertain. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hmv.co.uk">HMV.co.uk</a> listed it for the 19th, but still doesn&#8217;t have it in stock. Anyway.. to the point. :P I don&#8217;t know about you, but I really like documentary style music videos. The ones with lot&#8217;s of details you won&#8217;t get tired of after just watching once. The <a target="_blank" href="http://mcms-delivery.virtuebroadcasting.com/deliverMedia.asp?id=EEA060C8-69FD-46A9-8A87-9984880E47EA">video for YCT</a> is just like that and directed by Maria Mochnacz, who&#8217;s directed most of Polly Jean&#8217;s videos. She doesn&#8217;t seem to have her own webpage, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/mn/electriclight/maria.html">this interview</a> served as pretty good background info, and you can see more of her nice photography at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.klosslondon.com">Kloss Management</a>!
