The &#8220;On Ultimate Things&#8221; reissue can now be ordered from [Kirsty Hawkshaw&#8217;s][1] official site, but the details I mentioned [earlier][2] are a bit sketchy. The downloadable artwork is a scanned copy of the original 1998 version on [Coalition Records][3], mentioning no bonus material. Waiting for confirmation.

Update:  
&#8220;I will be adding two other tracks, one is an instrumental skit, and the other is the Lemon D mix of Sci-clone&#8221;.
