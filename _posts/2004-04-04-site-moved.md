So.. I finally moved the site from <a target="_new" href="http://www.digikom.net">Digikom</a> (those greedy bastards).  
Thanks to my great friend, <a target="_new" href="http://www.carlaberatio.com">Tobbe</a>, who is letting me run it on his account at <a target="_new" href="http://www.99kronor.com">99kronor.com</a>!  
The other news is this blog. I hope it will serve my purpose better. <a target="_new" href="http://www.movabletype.org">MovableType</a> is better coded than my old sloppy admin-thingie. :) I&#8217;ll change the design and some other functions (the live cam etc..) when I get the time.  
So welcome to the new redvolume.com, my blog. :)
