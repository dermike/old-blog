It took less than a week for spammers to get through the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/archives/2004/11/15/spambot-stopper/">Spam Stopgap</a> plugin I installed. Say hello to it&#8217;s big brother <a target="_blank" href="http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2004/11/29/spam-stopgap-extreme/">Extreme</a>. :) Elliot Back has added a dynamic client-side solution, forcing anyone wanting to submit a comment to execute a javascript. I&#8217;m not very fond of having to use javascript, but I guess it&#8217;s the mean necessary.
