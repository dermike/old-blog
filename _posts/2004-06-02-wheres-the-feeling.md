Where&#8217;s that June feeling? I feel nothing. Still feels like mid-spring. No summer music (only dark stuff), no heat (thank god for that.. I still want to be able to sleep) and no ice cream. I&#8217;ve decided friday will be the beginning of summer. Then I&#8217;ll get pizza for lunch and and this year&#8217;s first ice cream, thanks to my advance paycheck. Life is slowly returning. :) Saturday is barbecue time with my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.superpojkarna.nu">cousin</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.superpojkarna.nu">superpojkarna.nu</a> gang. He brought home 72 cases of beer from Germany last week. :9 And next week is boss&#8217; birthday. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m gonna go since he lives so remote. Maybe if I can get a lift.

Musically it&#8217;s autumn, with new stuff from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hocico.com/">Hocico</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pjharvey.net">PJ Harvey</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kaseychambers.com/">Kasey Chambers</a>.
