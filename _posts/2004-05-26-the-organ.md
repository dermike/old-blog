When everyone else is listening to the new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.morrissey-solo.com/">Morrissey</a> album, &#8220;You Are The Quarry&#8221; (which I&#8217;m quite disappointed in), I listen to canadian <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theorgan.ca/">The Organ</a> instead. Imagine a band that sounds like The Smiths but with Moz as a girl, and a lot more organ. There you go, The Organ! Now go discover while I go to bed! :) Good night&#8230;
