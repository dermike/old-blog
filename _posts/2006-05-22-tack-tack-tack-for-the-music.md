The official anthems are perfect examples of why football and music shouldn&#8217;t mix. [T!T!T!][1], the London club night featuring Swedish bands and DJ&#8217;s, might be the only exception. On June 20th, they bring some serious world cup action to [The Social&#8217;s][2] dance floor. Sweden vs England on a big screen with [Baggy Mondays][3] clashing the T!T!T! boys at the decks. I won&#8217;t see you there though, I just helped out designing their [MySpace][1] profile.
