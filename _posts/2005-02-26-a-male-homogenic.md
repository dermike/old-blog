It might be the electronica, or maybe his voice. [Ben Christophers&#8217;][1] &#8220;My Beautiful Demon&#8221; album makes me think of [Bj√∂rk's][2] &#8220;Homogenic&#8221;, with a twist of [Radiohead][3]. I saw him live in [Berlin][4] a couple of years ago, but I never bought that album until today at [Megastore&#8217;s][5] great 50% sale (along with [22 other][6] items). :)
