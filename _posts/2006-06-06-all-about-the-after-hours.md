The [Bpitch Control][1] [Loveparade][2] After Hours Party with [Ellen Allien][3], Sascha Funke and [Fra][4] at <del>WeekEnd</del> [Badeschiff][5] around noon on July 16 makes it possible to skip the main event at [Watergate][6] the night before without a guilty conscience&#8230; and with [Freakcamp][7] hosting a dubstep pre-party on the 14th, you might just need all the rest you can get in between.
