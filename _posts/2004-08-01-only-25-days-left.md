..to the release of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.diapazam.se">Blanka&#8217;s</a> debut album! I hope they can live up to the hype created by their EP, released last year. The CD will be 10 tracks long, filled with their characteristic neurotic, longing and desperate sound. This is what makes me wake up in the morning right now. :P I want it to be the 25th todaaaaaaaay.. :)  
They&#8217;re playing live later today at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.faulbaum.tk/">Faulfest #2</a> in Nacka, Stockholm, together with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brittapersson.com">Britta Persson</a>, who <a target="_blank" href="http://svante.linuxgods.com/index.php?p=56">Svante&#8217;s</a> been raving about. I&#8217;ll try to catch them. :)
