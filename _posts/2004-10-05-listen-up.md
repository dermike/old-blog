Started watching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/listen_up">Listen Up</a>, the new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbs.com">CBS</a> comedy starring <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004517/">Jason Alexander</a>, or George Costanza from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/">Seinfeld</a>, as most people would know him. :) As seen in season 2 of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hbo.com/larrydavid">Larry David&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#8221;, Jason probably wants to leave Costanza behind him. He&#8217;s not doing it with this show, that&#8217;s for sure. In &#8220;Listen Up&#8221;, I see his role of Tony Kleinman as a mature and grown up George with wife and kids. He&#8217;s got his dreamjob from Seinfeld as a sports writer- and commentator, but in this more family oriented show. This may not sound too good, but it&#8217;s definately not bad. I have a feeling it will grow on me.
