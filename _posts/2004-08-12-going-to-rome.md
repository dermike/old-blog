Haha.. [Fawlty Towers][1] suddenly feels like a great hotel after reading the comments about [this hostel][2] in Rome. Here&#8217;s one of them:

> &#8220;They stole all my clothes and money and kicked me out! Also threatened to hurt me if I came back with the cops.&#8221;

I&#8217;m almost curious to go there just to see how bad it really is. :P Maybe it&#8217;s some reverse psychology marketing.
