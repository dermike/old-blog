I was scared half to death this morning when my soundcard appeared to be dead. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winamp.com">Winamp</a> complained about damaged sound drivers, but a reinstall didn&#8217;t help. Then I noticed my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/slim_pc/slm/pro_slm_detail.php?UID=552">MSI Mega PC</a> display was showing all these random characters. Everything was solved by removing the power cable for a while, but I&#8217;m a little worried something&#8217;s not as it should be in there. I&#8217;m a complete beginner when it comes to hardware. Is it naive to blame bad electricity? :P
