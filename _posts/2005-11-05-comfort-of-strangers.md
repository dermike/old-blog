She&#8217;s definately no stranger any more. [Beth Orton&#8217;s][1] fourth album, &#8220;Comfort Of Strangers&#8221;, will be released on February 7th next year! 14 tracks produced by [Sonic Youth][2] guitarist Jim O&#8217;Rourke. As much as I&#8217;m excited by it, I&#8217;m also a little worried that it will turn out to be too minimal and boring, like [Emiliana Torrini&#8217;s][3] latest. [Four Tet][4] is good riddance at least, and the lack of electronica on it will probably be made up by her appearance on Massive Attacks [gothic soul][5] project. :)
