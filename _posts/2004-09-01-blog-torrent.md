I see the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.downhillbattle.org/labs/battletorrent/">Battle Torrent</a> project has now been renamed to &#8220;Blog Torrent&#8221;. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.downhillbattle.org/labs">Downhill Battle</a> lab is focusing on making sharing and downloading <a target="_blank" href="http://dessent.net/btfaq/">torrents</a> as easy as blogging. Both the tracker and the web interface are written in PHP and use no MySQL, so installing the software will be as simple as transfering files to a web server. Integration with common blogs such <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> is being worked on. The plan might be to be able to find all the latest torrents in your RSS-reader, but I can&#8217;t say I believe in a revolution. I&#8217;ll probably give this thing a chance when they get it running though.
