At <a target="_blank" href="http://rooster.linuxgods.com">Svante&#8217;s</a> request in my latest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/archives/2004/05/24/playlist_may_2004">playlist entry</a> I&#8217;ve posted my personal record shop guide (with map). For both Stockholm and online.  
  
<u>**Stockholm:**</u>

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/images/skivkarta.gif">Click here</a> for maps. (taken from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eniro.se">Eniro</a>).

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.skivfonstret.com">Skivfönstret</a>. Located in Ringen at Skanstull. My favourite shop at the moment. They almost always have the singles I want at their respective release dates, or earlier! Nice and knowledgeable staff.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.petsounds.se/">Petsounds</a>. Skånegatan 53 at Söder. Great for indie-stuff, but they&#8217;re not that fast getting the newest. In my opinion. I&#8217;m very impatient. :) 

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.soundpollution.com/">Soundpollution</a>. Stora Nygatan 18, Gamla Stan. When you need your dose of metal and hard electronica this is the place to go shop. They also have some indie. Nice staff. The cd covers are not in the best shape if you care about things like that.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.record-cdexchange.se/">Record & CD Exchange</a>. Gamla Brogatan 15, Norrmalm. Very wide range of everything from alternative to pop and progressive. They also have a good constant(?) sale.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ahlens.com/">Åhlens</a>. Sergels Torg, Norrmalm. Very underrated department store. I like it because of their punctual releases and their small price tags unlike the 50% wide ones they have on Megastore. Some good sale finds too.

St Eriksgatan, Vasastan. Not the name of a store, but a street with lot&#8217;s of nice second hand stores I won&#8217;t mention individually. Good for used cd&#8217;s and promos.  
Don&#8217;t miss Diamond Records which is located right under the bridge to Kungsholmen.

<u>**Online**</u>  
For better prices and no tags, go online!

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tweekitten.com">Tweekitten</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darla.com">Darla.com</a> (us). Indie indie indie.
