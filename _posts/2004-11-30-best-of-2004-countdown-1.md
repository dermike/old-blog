I&#8217;ve made no secret of that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.instrictconfidence.com">In Strict Confidence&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Holy&#8221; will end up on my top 10 albums list for 2004 ([here][1] and [here][2]). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidbowie.com/news/newsContent.php?id=20041124">David Bowie</a> isn&#8217;t very secretive about two of his favourites either. He wrote this about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mergerecords.com/">The Arcade Fire</a> in his journal:

> &#8220;Quite the most beautiful, moving and passionate piece of brilliant song-writing and quirky performance I&#8217;ve heard in YONKS !!!&#8221;

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesecretmachines.com/">Secret Machines</a> is supposed to come very close. Can&#8217;t say I feel for any of them. I&#8217;ll rather stick to the man himself. :) Anyway, just as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/archives/2004/01/01/best-of-2003/">last time</a>, you&#8217;ll find my list here on New Year&#8217;s Day.
