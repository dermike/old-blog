My [iBook][1] is coming, my iBook is coming! :) &#8220;Feb 7 or earlier&#8221;. I wanted a [Mac Mini][2] at first, but having two barebone computers felt a bit unnecessary. I&#8217;ve already practised some [MacOSX][3] in the [PearPC][4] emulator and ordered myself a small [wireless router][5] :). Only thing missing now is software. What&#8217;s the best (preferably free) FTP, IM and IRC clients out there?
