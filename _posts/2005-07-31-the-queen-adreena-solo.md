Probably most known as the singer of [Queenadreena][1], KatieJane Garside has gone solo with her project &#8220;lalleshwari / glasswilderness&#8221;, which will be released later this summer. Four tracks from it can be listened to over at [MySpace][2]. Kind of an interesting turn from the usual metal that&#8217;s behind her unique voice&#8230; but to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure I can consider this new stuff good compared to other triphopish electro-ambient. I&#8217;ll give the full project a chance when it&#8217;s out though. :)
