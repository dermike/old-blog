..when you see your boss as [Sloane][1], and think that new guy is like [Sark][2]. :) Only thing that can save me now is season 6 of [Red Dwarf][3] that was released on DVD yesterday (get it cheap over at [CD-Wow][4]). It&#8217;s my absolute favourite season of the show, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the &#8220;Psirens&#8221; episode again! It was one of those episodes you missed to record onto VHS. :)
