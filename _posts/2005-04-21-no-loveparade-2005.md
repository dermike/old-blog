Without sponsors or government support, [Loveparade][1] 2005 was cancelled today. Just as [last year][2], it was hard finding a [good sponsor][3]. Loveparade spokesperson, SÃ¼nje von Ahn, says they will put all their efforts in a comeback for 2006, right after the [football worldcup][4] in Germany.  
I'll get to see [Berlin][5] anyway this summer. The [Tori Amos][6] concert on June 21. :)
