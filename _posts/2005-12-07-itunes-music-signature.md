Dr. Jason Freeman has created the [iTunes Signature Maker][1], which is supposed to describe who you are and what you listen to by creating a short sonic signature of your iTunes music library. It takes brief bits from your favorite iTunes tracks (based on your ratings, play count or date) and mashes them together into a single file. [Here&#8217;s mine][2], based on my last played songs (AAC format).
