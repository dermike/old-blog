I&#8217;m surprised to see that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalhardcore.com">Alec Empire</a> has remixed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rammstein.com/">Rammstein&#8217;s</a> new &#8220;Amerika&#8221; single (International release on October 4). Alec questioned Rammstein&#8217;s sincerity in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1425050/19981109/story.jhtml">this interview</a> with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtv.com">MTV</a> back in 1998.

> &#8220;Rammstein is successful for all the wrong reasons. I think they&#8217;re not a fascist band at all, but I think in Germany there&#8217;s a lot of misunderstanding and that&#8217;s why they sell records and I think that&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;And I&#8217;m still waiting for them to make a real statement&#8221;

I wonder if this remix is his first step to selling out, or if the whole thing just have been straightened out?
