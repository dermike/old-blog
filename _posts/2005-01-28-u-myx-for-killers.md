The [U-Myx][1] software is back for a [second time][2] on the new single from [The Killers][3]. If you were [disappointed][4] before, you certainly will be this time as well. Nothing&#8217;s changed.. except for exporting, which has been disabled. Guess we have to thank the [label][5] for that though. The song, &#8220;Somebody told me&#8221;, was more fun stripping down and &#8220;remixing&#8221; than the [Muse][6] one at least. I put up my &#8220;Who needs guitars anyway&#8221; mix streaming <a href="http://www.redvolume.com/temp/killersumyx.html" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'popupwindow','width=200,height=200,scrollbars=no,resizable=no'); return false;">here</a>. (You will need [Flash][7] to hear it)
