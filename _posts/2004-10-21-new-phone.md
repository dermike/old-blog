&#8220;Haaaaappiness.. is a new phone lalala&#8221;.. at least in the material world. :) Bought a Sony Ericsson <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/z1010">Z1010</a> today. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tre.se">Tre</a> is selling them for 995 sek now if you buy it with a pre-paid simcard. Perfect! As a mobile geek I have this habit of getting a new one every year. :) I&#8217;m gonna disable the [Live Mobile Cam][1] for a while until I figure out another upload solution for this phone. My old <a target="_blank" href="http://direct.motorola.com/eng/producthome.asp?country=GBR&#038;language=ENG&#038;productid=29126">A920</a> could do about anything with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a> OS and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> browser. Guess I could give that away to someone now since I don&#8217;t even need the pre-paid sim.
