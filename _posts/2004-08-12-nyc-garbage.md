Why not buy some garbage from New York, packaged in a nice transparent plastic box? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nycgarbage.com">Justin Gignac</a>, the artist behind the sculptures, sells them for 50$ including world wide shipping. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d want something like that in my future apartment, but I really like the idea behind it. :)
