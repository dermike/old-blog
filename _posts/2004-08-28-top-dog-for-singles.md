Just got home from the recordfair, and I&#8217;m quite pleased with my findings:  
Baxter &#8211; I can&#8217;t see why (cdm), Leftfield &#8211; Release the pressure (cdm), Apocalyptica feat. Sandra Nasic &#8211; Path (cdm), Catatonia &#8211; Stone by stone (cdm), Emiliana Torrini &#8211; Baby blue (cdm). All for 135 sek. &#8220;Maybe cheapness is a sense?&#8221;, to quote from Seinfeld. :) The next skivm√§ssa will take place in one month, but this time in Solnahallen.
