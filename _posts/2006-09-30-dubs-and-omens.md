Netlabel [Virus B-23][1] is about to unleash their first two dubstep releases on 16th October. In this genre where exclusivity rules, most tunes never make it further than the dubplates of top DJ&#8217;s, which is why it&#8217;s great to see [more][2] and [more][3] upcoming producers taking advantage of the digital platform. First out on VB23 is [Markomen][4] with &#8220;Psychederelict Dubs Vol 1&#8243;, a 4 track EP, featuring fresh sounding and dark drifting dubstep with sparks of subtle acid, reminding me a lot of [Adrian Sherwood][5]. &#8220;Strawhead Riddim&#8221; is a killer track and well deserves it&#8217;s place on any media!
