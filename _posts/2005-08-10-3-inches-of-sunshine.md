I like 3 inch CD&#8217;s, and I have a feeling I&#8217;m gonna love this one! [In Strict Confidence][1], and [Melotron][2] will be releasing their own version of [A-ha&#8217;s][3] classic &#8220;The Sun Always Shines on TV&#8221; in September. Not only will the box contain the song, but also a special picture presentation that can be watched on TV. Only 2000 copies will be made, and judging from Melotron&#8217;s latest effort in synthpop, &#8220;Clich√©&#8221;, and ISC&#8217;s superb album from [last year][4], I just want to know when and where to preorder. :)  
Another collaboration I&#8217;d like to hear is between ISC and [Gary Numan][5]. He seems to be having some production problems with his upcoming album. A golden opportunity in other words.
