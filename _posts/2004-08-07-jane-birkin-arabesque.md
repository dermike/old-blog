Don&#8217;t miss the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.janebirkin.net/">Jane Birkin</a> concert on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.svt.se">SVT2</a> in 10 minutes. I know it&#8217;s late, but better late than never. :) 

> A recording from Odeon National Theatre in Paris 2002, where Jane Birkin reworks another set of songs by <a target="_blank" href="http://sergegainsbourg.artistes.universalmusic.fr/">Serge Gainsbourg</a> (1928-91). She&#8217;s accompanied by the Algerian arrangements of a North African band.

I guess it&#8217;s is the same concert as released on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000089QEF/104-6261847-4603140">DVD</a> earlier, which I&#8217;ve been wanting to see since then, so check that out if you can&#8217;t make it!
