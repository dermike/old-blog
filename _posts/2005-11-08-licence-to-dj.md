The health minister in [Bavaria][1] has issued a special &#8220;DJ licence&#8221;. The reason for it has nothing to do with bad taste or musical quality though. A written exam will make sure that DJ&#8217;s know how to handle sound with responsibility, which will hopefully lead to less hearing damages. Suffering from [tinnitus][2] myself, I think this is a great idea. Exaggerated? Maybe, but in this [iPod age][3], the problem is too serious to be over-looked. Just because it&#8217;s loud, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s good, so this might just increase the quality after all. :)
