Today I got an impulse to buy all those DVD&#8217;s I&#8217;ve been wanting for some time now. Before I moved, I sold off all movies I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d watch again. Not leaving that many left, I now try to keep my DVD shelf clean and essential. First I ordered [Criterion&#8217;s][1] gorgeous edition of [&#8220;Short Cuts&#8221;][2] from [CD-Wow][3]. Read the [review][4] of it at dvdforum.nu and drool. :) While surfing around at CD-Wow, I also decided to preorder the third season of Larry David&#8217;s [&#8220;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#8221;][5]. Great price! Finally having money to order the [Seinfeld][6] season 1+2 box, I couldn&#8217;t find a decent Swedish online store that had it in stock. Went out in the real world and bought it at [Megastore][7] instead. Later I stumbled onto the thriller [&#8220;Body Of Evidence&#8221;][8] while comparing prices for &#8220;Short Cuts&#8221;. [Madonna][9] and Julianne Moore in the same movie! Only 40 SEK including shipping from [DVDSoon.com][10]. That&#8217;s nothing to fuss about, even though I&#8217;m perfectly aware that it might not fit my new policy for the shelf. :)
