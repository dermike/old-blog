A [Porcupine Tree][1] solo projects sampler is now available to buy online from their [official store!][2] It contains 77 minutes of music (mostly instrumental?) from all of the members various solo and collaborative projects. This is a must buy for two reasons: Their latest album "Deadwing"¬ù is amazing, and the sampler only costs 3 pounds. :)
