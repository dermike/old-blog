Ah.. feels good to be home again, was my first though, and then I discovered that none of the mails I&#8217;ve sent to the blog have been delivered. :(( There seems to be something wrong with my pop-server. Oh well&#8230; I&#8217;ll remail them from the phone (with edited timestamps). It actually worked better than I though down there, except from the changing of network all the time. Here are some statistics:

Beers bought: 107  
Hansa towns: 3  
Wrong turns: 4  
Pics to [cam][1]: 6  
Hours in Berlin: 22  
U/S-bahn ticket raids: 30%

**Record shopping:**

Suicide Commando &#8211; One Nation Under God (Ltd Ed 2CDM)

Mia &#8211; Ökostrom (3&#8243; CDS + CDM)
