A recording of the [Monkeytribe][1] live set from [Subclub][2] on 28th January 2005 will be aired on [Radio Magnetic][3] this Wednesday! They&#8217;re behind one of last year&#8217;s [best albums][4], and performed some of their new material that night. Instrumental preview versions can be downloaded from their site. [Audio Hijack][5] should be able to record the show for me while I&#8217;m at work. The extreme buffering from Magnetic at the moment is driving me crazy.. The nice music and Scottish accent compensate for it though. :)  
Update: Upgrading to Windows Media Player 9 solved the buffering.
