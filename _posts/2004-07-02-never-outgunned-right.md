<a target="_blank" href="http://www.prodigy.co.uk/">Prodigy</a> is planning to release their new album &#8220;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&#8221; on August 24th. I can&#8217;t really say I&#8217;m looking forward to it after hearing the first single, &#8220;Girls&#8221; (featuring the Ping Pong Bitches). Uninspiring, boring crap compared to their second album &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&#038;uid=UIDSUB020406101548571599&#038;sql=A0udayl2oxpmb">Music For The Jilted Generation</a>&#8220;, which meant a lot to me in my early teens. :) Legends never die, but they can sure as hell disappoint. Other guests on the upcoming album will be the actress <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000496/">Juliette Lewis</a>, Oasis lead singer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oasisinet.com/">Liam Gallagher</a> and the rapper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.koolkeith.co.uk/">Kool Keith</a>.
