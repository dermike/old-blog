I have my indie days and my [grime][1] days, but I&#8217;m not so sure about this new crossover [grindie][2] thing [Statik][3] is pushing for. His upcoming mixtape &#8220;Grindie Volume 1&#8243; (download [here][4]) is filled with remixed indie hits, accompanied by various Mc&#8217;s. I&#8217;ll give it an honest chance, but I&#8217;d rather spend the next weekend listening to the new [Dubstep Allstars][5] compilation&#8230;
