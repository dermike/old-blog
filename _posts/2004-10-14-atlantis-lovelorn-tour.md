The Atlantis Lovelorn Tour visited <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debaser.nu">Debaser</a> in Stockholm this Tuesday. Fredrik Strage reviewed the gig in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1323&#038;a=331346&#038;previousRenderType=2">todays DN</a>. Apparently only about 50 people showed up. Might have been 51 if I&#8217;d found out about it in time. I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leaveseyes.de">Leaves&#8217; Eyes</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elis.de">Elis</a>&#8230; but the truth is, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have gone anyway. :P Not my type of crowd I guess. Also playing were <a target="_blank" href="http://www.battlelore.net/">Battlelore</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atrocity.de">Atrocity</a>.
