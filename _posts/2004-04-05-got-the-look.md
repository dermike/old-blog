I&#8217;m fixing a better design as you can see. I pretty much like this minimal thing. I think I&#8217;ll keep it. Lot&#8217;s of fine tuning left though.  
Listening to the new <a target="_new" href="http://www.dieform.net/">Die Form</a> album while I&#8217;m coding. Very good! If you think you&#8217;d like a harder and more gothish <a target="_new" href="http://www.delerium.com/">Delerium</a>, they are definately worth checking out.  
10 years since Kurt Cobain killed himself today. They played three of his Nirvana songs on the radio when I woke up. I should go dig out my Nirvana cds. Anyway.. Rest in peace Kurt.
