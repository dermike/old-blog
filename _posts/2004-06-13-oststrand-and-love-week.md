Ooh.. <a target="_blank" href="http://agnesoftheislands.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=32">Agnes.of.the.Islands</a> displays <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oststrand.de/oststrand_neu.html">Oststrand</a> in her blog (Swedish). Mustn&#8217;t forget to go there next time I&#8217;m in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a>, which I hope will be very very soon. I miss it so much. I can&#8217;t afford any travelling until this autumn when my monthly salary is more stable. :(  
What&#8217;s even more frustrating is that right in my vacation is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loveweek.de">Berlin Love Week</a>, the alternative for this years cancelled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loveparade.de">Loveparade</a>. A demonstration at the same location as Loveparade will take place though, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fightthepower.de/">Fight The Power</a>.

> &#8220;A week with ten days &#8211; instead of seven &#8211; filled with parties, club events but also open airs, professional meetings for DJs and musicians, and in between you&#8217;ll find yourself dancing barefoot at artificial beaches around river Spree.&#8221;

I guess that includes the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oststrand.de/oststrand_neu.html">Oststrand</a> area. Two flies in one stroke, and I can&#8217;t go. :(
