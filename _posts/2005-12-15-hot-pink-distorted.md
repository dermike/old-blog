&#8220;Hot Pink, Distorted&#8221; is the first track on [50 Foot Wave&#8217;s][1] &#8220;Free Music EP&#8221;, which is finally available [to download][2]! It&#8217;s offered in FLAC files as well as hi-resolution mp3 files. The band is also encouraging fans to seed BitTorrents and set up CD burning trees to ensure that people without time or technology may also receive the free music. As a big fan of Kristin Hersh, this is like early christmas. :) So good it hurts!
