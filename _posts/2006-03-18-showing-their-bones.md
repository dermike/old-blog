The new [Yeah Yeah Yeahs][1] album, &#8220;Show Your Bones&#8221;, is available in it&#8217;s entirety on their [MySpace page][2]. Few bands sound this good, great atmosphere! The title refers to what happens when you put your finger in a light socket, [according to][3] singer Karen O.  
-&#8221;Maybe there is some of that electric current flowing through the tracks of our album illuminating us from the inside out for you to laugh at and cry to or fry to. Or not.&#8221;
