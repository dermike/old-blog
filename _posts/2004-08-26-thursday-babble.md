My gums are infected somehow. Went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apoteket.se/">drugstore</a> to see if I could avoid an expensive visit to the dentist. They thought so. Someone sent me 250 monies. Don&#8217;t know why, don&#8217;t know who. I&#8217;m puzzled, but whoever sent it, thanks! They will come in handy for the [recordfair][1] this Saturday. And speaking of records&#8230; Got 3 copies of the new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hopeofthestates.com/">Hope Of The States</a> single from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hmv.co.uk">HMV</a> for some reason. 2 cd singles and one vinyl, all for the price of one. :) Installed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.suse.com">Suse</a> Linux 9.1. Need a good ftp client for it.
