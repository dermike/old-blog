Although their singles have been full of them, I didn&#8217;t expect a remix album from [Bloc Party][1]. It is to be released on August 29 according to [CD-Wow][2]. &#8220;Silent Alarm&#8221; is one of my absolute favourite albums so far this year, but I doubt this remixed version will improve anything at all, except for maybe the [Pretty Girls Make Graves][3] remix of &#8220;Positive Tension&#8221;, which I&#8217;m really looking forward to. :) That and their new album&#8230;
