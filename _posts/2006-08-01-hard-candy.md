I&#8217;ve been on such a tv-series trip lately, not feeling for movies at all. That changed tonight, being mesmerized by [&#8220;Hard Candy&#8221;][1]. I love minimalism in movies when it&#8217;s done right, and this is one of the slickest I&#8217;ve seen. Superb cinematography makes this naturalistic psychological drama something even [Strindberg][2] might&#8217;ve been proud of. The setting is in the Los Angeles home of photographer Jeff, a 32 year old man whom Hayley, a mature 14 year old girl who met him online, suspects to be a pedophile. These two leading parts stand for 95% of the acting in this movie and are amazingly performed by [Patrick Wilson][3] and [Ellen Page][4]. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to watch, but if you&#8217;re up for some psychological suspense, I highly recommend it!
