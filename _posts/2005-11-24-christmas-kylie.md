Everybody loves [Kylie][1]. On Christmas day she will release her first ever digital only single featuring the xmas classics, &#8220;Somewhere over the rainbow&#8221; and Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s &#8220;Santa Baby&#8221;. If you&#8217;re wondering about the rainbow song, it&#8217;s a UK thing. [&#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221;][2] is the special christmas movie over there. Anyway, the recording is taken from her upcoming live DVD, &#8220;Showgirl&#8221;. Gig of the year according to [The Times][3]&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure I wanna hear more xmas music at the time of release.
