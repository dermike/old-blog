The [Substance][1] party in Brussels last friday was simply amazing! Photos and recordings of [Walsh&#8217;s][2] and [N-Type&#8217;s][3] sets can be downloaded [here][4]. The harmonica jamming over dubstep was definately a unique experience. No wonder [my t-shirt][5] smelled when I got home. Can&#8217;t thank the FWF crew enough for their hospitality&#8230;
