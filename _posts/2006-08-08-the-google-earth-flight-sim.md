[Goggles][1] is a flight sim that uses images loaded in from [Google Earth][2]. While other sims are usually too advanced, this is also a very nice and fun way to navigate in the Google world. Both me and the game&#8217;s creator are looking for jobs, but I think his viral marketing will be far more successful than mine. :)
