&#8220;Hear we go&#8221;. [Berlin Sounds][1] is an audio tour to the sounds and electronic music of Berlin. You will be be guided by the DJ and producer [Anja Schneider][2] on your way through &#8220;Mitte&#8221; while you listen to the soundtrack by [Barbara Morgenstern][3], [Ellen Allien][4], [Mia][5] and [Jazzanova][6] among others. I really wish I had this when I was there in June. The [download][7] version is 7 euros. If you&#8217;d rather explore it from your couch at home, or simply want english language, I can very much recommend the [Berlin Digital][8] DVD which I&#8217;ve blogged about earlier.
