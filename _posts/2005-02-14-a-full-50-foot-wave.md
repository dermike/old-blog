The date has been set. [50 Foot Wave&#8217;s][1] full-length debut will be released on [4AD][2] March 7. Their original plan to release an EP every nine months [wasn&#8217;t taken seriously][3] by the music industry. I&#8217;m hoping this album will correct that attitude, giving them the recognition they deserve. I wish more bands had their energy and awareness about the needed change of the musical climate.
