I&#8217;m now lying in bed at the InterCity hotel in Stralsund. I had to kickstart the phone, which didn&#8217;t find a network on it&#8217;s own. On the ferry to Sassnitz, we had company with a bus full of accordion-playing teenage girls, coming directy from a band camp I guess. They played in groups all over the boat, not for money but for joy.. That&#8217;s nice, but having to hear &#8220;I did it my way&#8221; on the toilet is somewhat bizarre. :P

Time for a quick beer to the german version of &#8220;Cops&#8221; and then sleep.. We&#8217;re leaving for Berlin early in the morning.
