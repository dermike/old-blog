Well, I fell for it at least. :P <a target="_blank" href="http://absoluttracks.com/">AbsolutTracks</a> presents a smooth and stylish ride where four club music producers have interpreted the brand of <a target="_blank" href="http://absolut.com/">Absolut</a> Vodka. Free downloads of tracks and videos by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.djvadim.com/">DJ Vadim</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monikakruse.de/">Monika Kruse</a>, to mention the more well-known. I think I know what they want in return&#8230; Good, bad or ugly? It might not be the most ethical way to sell alcohol, but I like this kind of branding, keep them coming. :)
