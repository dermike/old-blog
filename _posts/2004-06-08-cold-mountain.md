Mmm.. Watching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159365/">Cold Mountain</a> really got me in a mood. :) I&#8217;ve become really romantic about the american south lately (I&#8217;m not very fond of the USA otherwise though). Listening to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.casadecalexico.com/">Calexico</a> almost makes me wanna sit on some front porch out in the desert, drinking Jim Beams out of the bottle.. hehe. Anyway..back to the movie, which was very good looking and had some nice acting by one of my favourite actresses, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000173/">Nicole Kidman</a>. What impressed me the most though was the music.

Jack White from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitestripes.com/">White Stripes</a>, which I&#8217;m not really a fan of (except &#8220;Seven Nation Army&#8221;), sang a few songs in the movie. MickeS pointed out to me that he also produced the new album of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lorettalynn.com/">Loretta Lynn</a>. Jack really did a good job putting his sound to it. :)
