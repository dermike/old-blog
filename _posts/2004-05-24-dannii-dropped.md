<a target="_blank" href="http://www.danniimusic.com">Dannii</a>, my favourite Minogue musically, is rumoured to have been dropped from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wmg.com/">Warner</a>.

> &#8220;Dannii won&#8217;t be releasing another record with Warner. She enjoyed some success but just doesn&#8217;t sell enough records to merit a new deal.&#8221;

This is probably a good thing. I hope she will picked up by an electronica based label for some more electroish sound. Apparently she seems to be writing some new material with the legendary songwriter Billy Steinberg, who&#8217;s behind the hits &#8220;Like a virgin&#8221; and &#8220;Eternal flame&#8221; among others. I hope that won&#8217;t be a problem for being picked up by a not-so-commercial electro label. I&#8217;ll keep my thumbs crossed. :)
