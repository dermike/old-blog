Phew.. Just got home stressed to the limit (well, some limit). :P Went early from work to catch the 70% cd closing sale my local <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rocks.se/">Rocks records</a> is having. Luckily I&#8217;m getting an advance pay from work so I could afford some. :) Most of the good ones were sold already so I focused on getting some country I never really wanted to pay full price for.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.allisonmoorer.com/site/">Allison Moorer &#8211; Miss Fortune</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shelbylynne.com/">Shelby Lynne &#8211; Love Shelby</a>  
Got those from a tip by MickeS. They better be good&#8230; for his sake. :P

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.marygauthier.com/">Mary Gauthier &#8211; Filth And Fire</a>  
I&#8217;ve been wanting that since it was released. Just never found it for the right price before. :) Too bad I missed her when she performed at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debaser.nu/">Debaser</a> here in Stockholm.

<a target="_blank" href="http://launch.yahoo.com/artist/default.asp?artistID=1029278">Victoria Williams &#8211; Water To Drink</a>  
Thought of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lucindawilliams.com/">Lucinda Williams</a> when I bought it, but it should be good enough for the price anyway. Total: 167 SEK.

Now off to speedpack for Gothenburg&#8230; Back on sunday!
