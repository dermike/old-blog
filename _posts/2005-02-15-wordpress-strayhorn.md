Bold and beautiful, I instantly upgraded [WordPress][1] to the new 1.5 &#8220;Strayhorn&#8221; release. The [upgrade guide][2] was very helpful, but I still need to find out how to convert my old wp-comments.php to the new Theme system. All my old plugins seem to work just fine (including Spam Stopgap [Extreme][3]).

Update: Had some troubles with trackbacking, but this [bug-report][4] did the trick.
