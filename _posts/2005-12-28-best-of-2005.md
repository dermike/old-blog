It&#8217;s harder than usual this year. 2005 has seen a great number of releases, from both debutants and veterans, I can still only come up with 5 albums that I&#8217;ve really loved. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m disappointed, but I feel more comfortable listing my 5 favourites and 10 highlights instead of my usual top 10 (sorted by date of release).

**Bloc Party &#8211; Silent Alarm**  
Their ecstatic indie rock blows me away every time.  
Favourite track: &#8220;Like Eating Glass&#8221;

**Mary Gauthier &#8211; Mercy Now**  
Dark and gritty country with a southern gothic ambience that really drags you in.  
Favourite track: &#8220;Falling Out Of Love&#8221;

**Porcupine Tree &#8211; Deadwing**  
Less progressive and more rock. Just the way I like it.  
Favourite track: &#8220;Shallow&#8221;

**The New Pornographers &#8211; Twin Cinema**  
More addictive power-pop hooks than this is hard to find.  
Favourite track: &#8220;Stacked Crooked&#8221;

**Madonna &#8211; Confessions On A Dance Floor**  
Stuart Price is definately producer of the year in my book.  
Favourite track: &#8220;Jump&#8221;
