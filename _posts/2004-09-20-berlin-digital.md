..<a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin-digital.com">A Guide Through The Electronic Music Scene</a> was a very nice experience! This documentary DVD takes you on a journey through the largest scene for electronic music worldwide. Interviews with artists, record labels, companies and distributors, gives you a rough overview of the subculture. Their enthusiasm and love for music is really infectious, and shines through the screen. :) I feel very inspired after watching it, and would recommend it to any fan of electronic music, especially if you like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlin.de">Berlin</a> sound.
