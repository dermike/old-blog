Three songs from [Aimee Mann&#8217;s][1] upcoming studio album is now available as streams on her [website][2]! &#8220;King of the Jailhouse&#8221; has been out since November on her [live album][3] though. It&#8217;s her fifth solo release, with a dozen songs that tell the story of John and Caroline. A concept album like the musical equivalent of a novella. Since her lyrics are usually short stories set to music, I&#8217;m very sure she will succeed where other concept albums have failed. :) If you [preorder][4], you will receive a 32-page lyric book with photos of Aimee and illustrations from the album. Might actually be worth to skip [CD Universe][5] this time.
