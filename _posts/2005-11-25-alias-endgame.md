I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m sad or just relieved. [ABC][1] has decided to end [Alias][2] for good with this season 5 in May 2006. The fourth season [really sucked][3], but it seems the series will get a worthy ending. Season 5 has been a great comeback so far, and ABC president promises &#8220;Alias is not going to wind down as it comes to an end, it&#8217;s going to rev up, and we&#8217;re going to make it the event it deserves to be&#8221;&#8230;
