Found a very interesting [article][1] about lithium battery care. I usually wait until the battery is completely drained before recharging, but since a lithium-ion battery provides about 300-500 charge cycles, it&#8217;s better to just recharge it partially. I&#8217;ll definately change my battery habits from now on. Save a battery&#8217;s life. :)
