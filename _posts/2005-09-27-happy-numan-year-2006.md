It looked really bad for a while, but together with a new producer, [Gary Numan][1] is back on track, recording his new album. Pushed back from October to March 2006, the rework has left a lot of material for alternative album releases, single extra tracks and downloads etc.

> &#8220;The Numan fan in 2006 is going to have more new Numan music than in any other year of my career.&#8221;

To get a taste of what&#8217;s coming, he&#8217;s posted [2 clips][2] of rough material for those who are curious. I can&#8217;t say I hear much of the &#8220;new sound&#8221;, but there&#8217;s no need to change it for my sake anyway. :)
