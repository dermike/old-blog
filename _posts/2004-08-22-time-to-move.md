It&#8217;s as good as settled now, I&#8217;m moving in with my good friend Martin. But first when I&#8217;ve found a better job and can actually afford to split the rent. You wouldn&#8217;t believe how tired I am of this commision thing with nothing to do. Desperately seeking another job. All help is welcome. :) I made a little <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/temp/martinlgh.gif">drawing</a> of the apartment from my memory. The proportions are a bit off, but you&#8217;ll get the picture. :)
