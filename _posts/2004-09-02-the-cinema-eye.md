Yay! They&#8217;ve finally updated <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecinemaeye.com">their site</a> with a track from their upcoming album! <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sound-virus.com/">Sound Virus</a> will bring it to you on November 2. Give it a listen if you like dark, synthish, new wave, post punk. Hard to describe. Even Mollie from the band is not really sure how to put it:

> &#8220;The thing about the Cinema Eye is that while we definitely touch base with stuff that&#8217;s already been done, there&#8217;s a newness about it that I can&#8217;t really define. I mean, we&#8217;re not out to create some new genre of music, that&#8217;s definitely not happening, but its just got this&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, foreign quality. It just sounds different.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;A keyboard band that isn&#8217;t a keyboard band.&#8221;
