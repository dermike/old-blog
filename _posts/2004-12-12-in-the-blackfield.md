<a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackfield.org">Blackfield&#8217;s</a> self titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.recordstore.co.uk/blackfield/">download single</a> is released today! 99p per track or 1.50Â£ if you buy all 3 via SMS (UK only). The live acoustic version was the only one with more value to it. Different edits don&#8217;t mean that much to me when the overall &#8220;sound&#8221; is the same&#8230; and since they&#8217;re not coming to Sweden on their tour, that&#8217;s as close as I get. I really hope <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nomansland.demon.co.uk/">Steven Wilson</a> will come here on the next <a target="_blank" href="http://www.porcupinetree.com">Porcupine Tree</a> tour at least. Their [new album][1] is due out in January 2005. (The other member of Blackfield is the Israeli singer/songwriter <a target="_blank" href="http://www.avivarchive.co.il/">Aviv Geffen</a>).
