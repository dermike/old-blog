The magnificent [Criterion Collection][1] will be extended with a full, uncut DVD version of [The Man Who Fell To Earth][2], starring [David Bowie][3], this september! Full details [here][4]. September is also the month when we get to see the DVD release of his spaghetti western movie, [Gunslinger&#8217;s Revenge][5] (more [details][6]). The list just grows, I haven&#8217;t even gotten myself the 2 latest seasons of Seinfeld or Dead Like Me yet..
