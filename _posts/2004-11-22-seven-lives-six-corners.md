Finally some good news today! One of my favourite albums of 2004 is &#8220;Holy&#8221; by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.instrictconfidence.com">In Strict Confidence</a>. They make very slick (somewhat popish), gothic electronica and have a new EP out soon. The title, &#8220;Seven Lives&#8221;, is a track from the album. Not only will it be about 80 minutes in lenght, but also a 6-side digipack with rounded corners. Apparently the first cd-cover in this style in Europe. Released December 13th on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minuswelt.de">Minuswelt</a>. Hope it won&#8217;t be too expensive. I&#8217;m very curious about the new songs and cover. :) There&#8217;s almost no cd&#8217;s left to look forward to this year. Or am I wrong?
