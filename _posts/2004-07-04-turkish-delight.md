I&#8217;m doing a trade with a guy on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebay.de">ebay.de</a>. He wants 6 copies of the turkish singer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sertab.net/">Sertab</a>&#8216;s single, &#8220;Leaving&#8221;. Apparently it&#8217;s not available there. He and his friends must be really big fans. I guess swedes are considered as a big fans too since it&#8217;s only(?) released here. All I know is that she made a pretty good cover of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bobdylan.com/">Bob Dylan&#8217;s</a> &#8220;One More Cup Of Coffee&#8221; for the movie &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319829/">Masked And Anonymous</a>&#8220;&#8230;  
..and for my last cup of coffee of the day, I made some chocolate balls from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redvolume.com/temp/recept.gif">this recipe</a>, which I&#8217;ve used since I was a kid. It&#8217;s almost a story of my skills in the kitchen. :)
