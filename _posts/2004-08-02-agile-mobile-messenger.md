Just installed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agilemobile.com">Agile Messenger</a> for my <a target="_blank" href="http://direct.motorola.com/eng/producthome.asp?country=GBR&#038;language=ENG&#038;productid=29126">Motorola A920</a>, and it&#8217;s working like a charm! The interface is so much better than in <a target="_blank" href="http://my-symbian.com/uiq/applications/applications.php?fldAuto=62&#038;faq=6">myBuddies</a> which I was using before.

> Agile Messenger is an Instant Messenger for your mobile telephone supporting ICQ, AIM, Yahoo!, MSN, QQ and Wireless Village

It&#8217;s got tons of nice features, including data usage counter, and supports most mobile platforms available today. The best feature though is the price&#8230; It&#8217;s free! :)
