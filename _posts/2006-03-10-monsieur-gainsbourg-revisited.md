I&#8217;ve never heard any of [Serge Gainsbourg&#8217;s][1] songs in english before, but the new &#8220;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&#8221; cover compilation just made me appreciate one of my biggest musical idols even more! [Cat Power][2] & Karen Elson&#8217;s &#8220;I Love You (Me Either)&#8221;, [The Kills][3] &#8220;I Call It Art&#8221; and Marianne Faithful with Sly & Robbie&#8217;s &#8220;Lola R Forever&#8221; are amazingly beautiful new versions that leave me teary eyed! While the rest by Franz Ferdinand, Placebo, Michael Stipe, Portishead and Tricky among others lack that unique passion or musical quality, they&#8217;re still interesting in the language point of view. It&#8217;s definately a 2006 essential.
