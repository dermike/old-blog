I got off early from work today&#8230; nothing to do as usual. :/ It gave me time thought to really listen to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fidget.de">FiDGEt</a> album that I finally got on CD yesterday! I&#8217;ve been hooked ever since their &#8220;Dixon EP&#8221;, and I could probably say they&#8217;re one of my favourit bands ever. :) &#8220;Celebrate Another Day Living&#8221; is their debut album. They kind of have their own sound, crossing over metal, punk and rock. The singing is very powerful and emotional, Tom and philipine Darline mix boy/girl vocals. Love the sound, love the energy, I never get tired of them&#8230; so far at least. :)  
Now let&#8217;s see how good <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364045/">Taking Lives</a> is&#8230; Interesting mix of actors.. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/">Angelina Jolie</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000160/">Ethan Hawke</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000662/">Kiefer Sutherland</a>! Speaking of Kiefer.. Don&#8217;t miss the DVD release of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24 Season 3</a> on August 9th in the UK! Update: Ok, it wasn&#8217;t. :P Typical serial killer movie.. Nothing I&#8217;d recommend really.
