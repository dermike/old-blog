They&#8217;re both icelandic, but I&#8217;ll always choose <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emilianatorrini.com/">Emiliana Torrini</a> over <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bjork.com/">Bj√∂rk</a>. From Emiliana&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emiliana.nu">fansite</a>, I found out that she&#8217;s working on a new album called &#8220;Fisherman&#8217;s Wife&#8221;. If everything goes as planned, the record will be out in January 2005, on the great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roughtraderecords.com/">Rough Trade</a> label. :)
