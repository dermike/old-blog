After a tough year, [Kirsty Hawkshaw][1] is finally back with somewhat more independent projects for 2005! She&#8217;s been working alongside DJ&#8217;s and dance producers for a couple of years now to take the pressure off with promotion, and spend time with her baby instead. Here&#8217;s what to look for:

*The Centre Cannot Hold EP* by [Digitonal][2]  
Features Kirsty on the track &#8220;Mari Stella&#8221;. Her ethereal vocals in combination with their beautiful, progressive and organic electronica is simply outstanding. Released on [Seed][3].

*Mini Album* on [Big Chill][4]  
Working with Andy Dobson from Digitonal, there will hopefully be a mini album out soon on the Big Chill label. The music will be similar to what she released on [O.U.T][5].

*On Ultimate Things* re-released through the [website][1]  
Her great solo debut with some minor changes. The cover song &#8220;For You&#8221; will be replaced by another. There will also be some bonus tracks, most likely previously unheard remixes. Should be available for order online by the end of February.
