I was very surprised to find an orchestrated version of [Jeff Mills&#8217;][1] techno classic &#8220;The Bells&#8221; on [iTunes][2]. Celebrating it&#8217;s 10th anniversary this year, this bizarre sounding recording originates from a live concert together with the national philharmonic orchestra of Montpellier at [Pont Du Gard][3] in France last summer. The whole performance, which looks amazing in the trailer, is to be released as CD and DVD in March on [UWe][4]. Titled &#8220;Blue Potential&#8221;, it features 16 tracks total, including two from the [Underground Resistance][5] label.
